<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are occasions when the craft of the critic becomes especially
delightful, and at the same time especially dangerous. Delightful, when
the material in which he works is new and unessayed; dangerous, from
the besetting temptation to be content with accredited methods, and to
neglect that watchful regard to the texture of the clay, which alone
can suggest the conditions of successful treatment. Of such delicate
fabric is a man made, here and there. It is as if for a moment the
common matter had been thrown aside wearily, as if Nature, when she
wrought him, had been toying with an inspiration, sometimes happy,
often unhappy. In dealing with such a man, the critic will proceed very
patiently and tenderly. He will beware of presenting him, morally or
otherwise, in the light of the prevailing prejudice; nor will he erect
his own provincialities of opinion as a final
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
measure of wisdom or worth. Rather will he let the man go his own way
and tell his own tale, content if he may but follow and hear and understand,
 without sitting in the gate to judge him.</p>

<p>That criticism, in the case of the Marquis d'Argenson,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> has not
always been chastened to this wholesome deference, there will be
occasion to notice at a later date. We may remark at once how necessary
it was. D'Argenson was indeed no ordinary man. The character with which
destiny had endowed him was but poorly adapted to the social medium in
which it was to move; and to the great world where moral commonplace is
law, he was a stranger. He dwelt, as such men do, in a little world of
his own creating, peopled with his own pleasures and his own pains. His
only critic was his conscience: himself was his sternest judge: and he
knew no tribunal but the midnight silence, when the glow was dying on
the hearth. He was an original, in short, and as an original he must be
treated.</p>

<p>When we are puzzled by the character of any among the illustrious dead,
and when other resources fail us, a saunter in the portrait gallery of
the old house is often pregnant with suggestion. Of such a privilege it
will be well to avail ourselves in the present instance. The time will
be very well spent.</p>

<p>In the days when Mazarin was king, France had no more able or trusted
servant than René de Voyer, Count d'Argenson. He was a nobleman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of old Touraine&mdash;one of his ancestors had sailed with St. Louis<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;
and now in these latter days, he worthily fulfilled the promise of his
name by a rich devotion to his country and her master. Mazarin knew
his worth. He commends him to Cardinal Grimaldi as "<i>huomo versato
e prudente</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
a phrase which is translated in an earlier letter
to d'Argenson himself, where he compliments him on "<i>la prudence et
l'adresse</i>" with which he had governed the Catalans.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> His life was
passed amid the stress and movement of affairs, the scene changing as
circumstances of delicacy and danger called for the intervention of
an accomplished hand. Only once, in 1640, is the sequence of activity
broken, to reveal to us a sidelight of character which is brightly
suggestive. Released for a time from the cares of administration&mdash;he
had fallen into the hands of the Spaniards<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&mdash;he employed the leisure
so rudely thrust upon him in translating Thomas à Kempis, and in
composing a treatise on "The Wisdom of a Christian." Years after, now
grown old in the King's service, he laid aside the sword and robe, to
don the cassock and die a servant of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The portrait is broadly drawn, but already the features are clearly
marked.</p>

<p>We pass on to his son, René II.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> We are at once arrested. Were it not
for the doublet and hose of the seventeenth century, we should mistake
him for his own grandson. Young René de Voyer was destined, like his
father, for the diplomatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
service. His political pilgrimage had scarce begun
when a cloud fell across his path. A rumour got abroad to the effect
that the youthful diplomatist would be also a poet, and moreover, that
he gave more time to religious exercises than was good for a young
man who had the world before him. And so it was that when d'Argenson
left for Venice with the King's commission, there was some misgiving
in exalted circles; prayer and praise might be all very well, but
they were not among the recognised resources of earthly diplomacy.
Be that as it may, d'Argenson succeeded in commending himself to the
citizens of the Republic.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> At home he was not so fortunate. As his
grandson observes, the embassy was a mistake.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In the first place,
the thousand little complaisances, respectable and other, which were
among the first conditions of comfort at court, were quite beyond
him. Practically they filled him with despair, morally with disgust.
Moreover he was cursed with that species of reserve which often comes
of extreme humility, and is almost always attributed to extreme pride.
When things went wrong at headquarters, he took to railing against
the vices of the great; he fell out with Mazarin as he afterwards did
with Colbert; and finally, after a few years of thankless labour,
he was dismissed, and the door of advancement was closed against
him. D'Argenson accepted his fate. He shut himself up on his country
estates, consoling himself with the thought that he was an injured
man.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
But he was not of the men who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
can sit down and nurse their
disappointments. Though cruelly broken, he set to work to repair his
fortune and to repair his life. In the provinces of France, on the
slopes of Touraine, there was plenty of work for a willing hand, as
events too clearly proved. In that work d'Argenson found refuge
from his manifold chagrins. The rest of his life&mdash;he was still
but thirty-two<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
&mdash;was devoted to the
development of his estates and to the welfare of his dependents.
"Interested in the improvement of education and manners in the country,
he gathered the peasantry together for lectures, instructing them
himself, and exhorting them to the practice of their duties."<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
So he died, a failure, of a kind; one of those rich-souled men who are
never successful until they fail. He bequeathed to posterity a number
of devotional works, a "Paraphrase of the Prophet Jeremiah," an
"Exposition of the Book of Job," and others of a like character. Yet,
though entrenched behind numerous theological quartos, his orthodoxy
was sadly open to attack. Having built a church, he dedicates it to the
"Eternal Father," in scandalous disregard of the company of the saints.</p>

<p>Already it is apparent that we have to deal with men of singular force
of character and fulness of soul. Evidently it was no mere freak
of fortune which made the grandson of this luckless ambassador the
greatest political moralist of his time.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Practical vigour, moral
depth, they are in the blood of the d'Argensons. They look down upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
us from the last canvas before which it is necessary
to linger, the portrait of "Mon Père."</p>

<p>At the climax of the Grand Age, ere the slope of Avernus had yet begun,
the King's justice was administered in the district of Angoulême by as
strange a magistrate as ever shocked the susceptibilities of a court.
He was in the prime of life, tall, dark, with striking features, and
a glance that was charming and might be terrible. A strange figure
did he make in that district court of Angoulême, as he sat dispensing
justice quick and plentiful, patching up suits, cutting down fees,
driving a vigorous pen through venerable formalities, and fondling
the muzzle of his great hound, who sat blinking placidly upon the
fuming functionaries, without the faintest sense of his unwarrantable
intrusion.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
So things went on until, in 1694, a special commission
for the reform of abuses in the administration of justice appeared
in Angoulême. My lords discovered, probably with equal surprise, the
absence of abuses, and the presence of an extraordinary man. Of his
capacity as a magistrate they had ample evidence before them; and the
lighter experiences of a commission on circuit were sufficient to
convince them that M. d'Argenson was excellent company, a man brimful
of life and energy, whose wit sparkled with his wine.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> To leave him to rust in a
provincial court was of course out of the question. He
was plied with hearty invitations to Paris and generous promises of
service. "As a matter of fact, my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
father was not an ambitious man";<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and it was
only after much solicitation that he was decoyed to the capital, and
introduced by M. de Caumartin, his friend of the commission, to the
reigning Controller-General. Three years afterwards, at the age of
thirty-nine, he was appointed chief of the Parisian police; and for
twenty years and more, from the time of Ryswick to well on in the
Regency, he became "the soul, always in action, scarcely ever in
evidence,"<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
the soul of the great metropolis.</p>

<p>Henceforth his life was an eventful one. Criticism, caricature,
opinion of all sorts, fastened upon it as a delectable morsel; its
incidents were recorded, politely in the pages of contemporary memoirs,
impolitely upon the walls of Paris. With the events themselves we are
not concerned; we pursue them only for the character of the man. This
is no place to relate how, when the woodyards of the Porte St. Bernard
were on fire, he saved a quarter by the sacrifice of his clothes;<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
how in the year of Malplaquet, when bread was nine sous a pound and the
Quartier du Temple took the pavement, he risked his life in confronting
the mobs;<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> or to recall the memorable day when he presents a 'lettre
de cachet' to the Abbess of Port Royal with a request for compliance
within fifteen minutes;<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> or later, when, in the King's name, he was
called upon to entertain one "François Marie Arouet, twenty-two, of no
profession," in the Bastille,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and to be immortalised as a worthy
successor of Cato in six tearfully cheerful verses.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
received the highest eulogy known to the classicism
of the time. "He was made to be a Roman," writes Fontenelle,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> his
fingers trembling with unwonted enthusiasm, "and to pass from the
Senate to the head of an army." And the daily routine was no less
imposing. In toil unceasing, he forgets the distinction between night
and day,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> eats when he must, sleeps when he can. We see him dictating
letters to four secretaries at a time,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> dining in his carriage
as it rattles over the stones,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> vouchsafing an audience to a La
Rochefoucauld at two in the morning.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> His pleasures when he could
snatch them were rich and strong. He had a lusty interest in life and
living, and a hearty contempt for the Talon Rouge. D'Argenson's heels
were of good cow-hide, and not wholly free from the mould of Touraine.
His boon companions were not ministers and great lords, but "unknown
men of the lower ranks," with whom, it is important to notice, "he
was more at home than with people of more exalted station."<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> "In
a gentlemanly way, he was fond of wine and women."<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> In the latter
regard, his tastes were too catholic to be altogether creditable; but
"he preferred nuns," as his son remarks, with a smile of remembrance at
the old days. In fact, he had rigged up a lodging in the precincts of
the Convent de la Madeleine de Traisnel; and all the magnificence of
Versailles was less to him than an evening in the company of the Lady
Superior.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> But not even the charms of Madame du Veni could wean him from his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
devotion to duty. Paris never had such a chief of
police.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Evil-doers trembled at the name of him; mobs, whether in the
galleries of Versailles or in the faubourgs of Paris, quailed beneath
his glance. They might well. When he liked, "he had a face that was
frightful, and recalled those of the three judges of hell!"<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> But
there is another side to all this. St. Simon, who liked him less than
he admired him, says that "in the midst of his painful functions, he
was always to be touched by the voice of humanity;"<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and there is a
little picture, from the hand of Fontenelle, which tells so much that
it must be placed upon the line. It is the picture of an audience at
the bureau of police. "Surrounded and deafened by a crowd of people of
the lower orders, most of them hardly knowing what had brought them
there, violently agitated about matters of the most trifling nature and
often only half understood, accustomed not to rational speaking but
to senseless noise, he had neither the carelessness nor the contempt
which the applicants and their affairs might well have induced; he gave
himself up whole-heartedly to the meanest details, ennobled in his eyes
by their necessary relation to the public good; he suited himself to
ways of thinking the lowest and the most gross; he talked to every one
in his own tongue."<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> And so for the space of one-and-twenty years
Marc René d'Argenson went his way, more loved and feared than any man
in Paris. But that was not all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>In September, 1715, the Grand Monarque died; and Liberalism gathered up
the reins and went cantering gaily into a morass. After three years,
d'Argenson was called upon to help it out. These were the days of the
great "System," and of the encampment in the Rue Quincampoix. The
Regent, abandoning his chemical researches, had been studying alchemy
under John Law. For some time the great Experiment had been going well,
altogether too well, it appeared, as difficulties gathered round it
one by one. One obstacle had to be removed, cost what it might. On
acceding to power, Orleans, in the innocence of his heart, had restored
to the Parlement the right of remonstrance. Messieurs of the Long
Robe had so far presumed upon his confidence as to attempt to use it.
Strong measures became necessary, and a strong man. The old chancellor,
d'Aguesseau, retired, and in January, 1718, d'Argenson received the
seals.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
On the 26th of August the crisis had come, and King and
Parlement were face to face in the hall of audience at the Tuileries.
"At last all was arranged and the assembly had resumed their seats.
For a few moments"<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> there was a dead silence, while the gaze of
many besides St. Simon was fixed upon a solitary seat below the King.
"Motionless on his bench sat the Warden of the Seals, his look bent
upon the ground, while the inward fire that played from his eyes seemed
to penetrate every heart." He rose and delivered his memorable speech.
The Parlement began their remonstrance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
when suddenly the voice of d'Argenson
rang clear and crushing: "What the King requires is obedience, and upon
the spot!"<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
and the protest was silenced as by a "clap of thunder." It was a day
of bitter humiliation for the Parlement and of triumph for their old enemy.</p>

<p>Other events of his ministry were less impressive, but not less
important. As President of the Council of Finance (January, 1718),
he succeeded during his first year in extinguishing arrears to the
amount of sixteen million livres;<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and he was the first to apply
the system of direct collection (Régie) in regard to certain of the
taxes.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> As a financial minister he had only one failing. His homely
prejudice in favour of honest dealing sometimes got him into trouble
with the Regent;<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> but their occasional quarrels were only on the
surface; and when d'Argenson was dismissed, as he was in June, 1720,
for speeding the Bank upon its downward way,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> he was allowed to
keep his emoluments and his violet robe:<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and a few years after he
had quitted office, the Regent sent him a purse of gold, which was an
annual perquisite of the Warden of the Seals.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>St. Simon shall finish the picture.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"His retirement was of the strangest. He withdrew into a convent in
the Faubourg St. Antoine, called La Madeleine de Tresnel. A long time
before, he had fitted up an apartment in the convent buildings which he
had furnished handsomely and well. It was as convenient as a house,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and for many years he was in the habit of going there as often as he
could. He had procured, even given, large sums to this convent for the
sake of a Madame du Veni, who was the Superior&mdash;a relation,
he said&mdash;and of whom he was very fond. She was a very charming
person, extremely witty, and one of whom none have ever thought of
speaking ill. All the Argensons paid court to her; but
the strange thing about it was that when he was chief of police and
fell ill, she left her convent to come to his house and to remain near
him."<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A strong man and a strange one, and withal, a lovable, as we
learn from many besides Madame du Veni.</p>

<p>In June, 1720, his "brief and troublous ministry"<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> came to an end,
and the Palais Royal knew him no longer. He had but a short time to
enjoy the rest which had come to him as a happy release. On May 8,
1721, he died. Many was the shrewd encounter he had had with the rabble
of the slums; and
as the old chief was borne to his last home, he was
pursued by the curses of the basket-women of Paris. And hearing of it,
proud and beautiful old Mathieu Marais turned in disgust from "this mad
populace, which, while he lived, dared never look him in the face;" and
alone with his journal, with his mind upon the man who had passed away,
he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Who will have his soul, I know not. In the other world, as in this,
there must be a fine debate over it."<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He left behind him one who was to uphold the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
honour of a worthy
name, and to bequeath to criticism an exercise no less perplexing. Upon
the features of his son, the Marquis d'Argenson of history, the family
lineaments are clearly marked. The moral fibre, the exuberant vitality,
the rough irreverence for the world and its ways, which distinguished
the men whose portraits have been sketched, descended to the heir of
their name. We have but to see how the given material was affected
by the influence of an inauspicious training, to be in possession of
the radical substance of d'Argenson's character. In default of such
knowledge of the man and his mind, it is impossible to criticise his
life with justice; for without the secret of his singularities of
temper, one is tempted to yield to that haste and impatience which
they are too often apt to provoke. The secret once discovered, there
is no longer any room for irritation; but we are content to pity him
for the weaknesses of his character, while we admire him for its real
nobility.</p>

<p>He is a young man, very dark, with clear-cut features, his eye glancing
with a rough vivacity as he plies his pen with nervous hand. There is
a future before him; and, though he cannot be more than eighteen or
nineteen,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> he has already a past.</p>

<p>René Louis de Voyer d'Argenson was born at Paris in 1694, in the same
year as two puissant men whose fortunes were to intersect his own, the
Englishman, Henry St. John, and his friend and countryman Voltaire. Two
years later he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
joined by his brother, Marc Pierre, known to history
as the astute and charming Count d'Argenson. His father, who had but
lately come to Paris, was as yet known only as a rising Master of
Requests; his mother was a sister of the distinguished de Caumartin, M.
d'Argenson's patron and sponsor in the official world. Among his other
natural endowments, the young René Louis possessed, and was possessed
by, an expansive imagination; he early conceived and resolved upon a
career. Before he was well in his teens, he was leading his brother
along those devious courses by which a wholesome boy was to be turned
into a fine gentleman and a man of the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We were not born libertines, but are become so. I saw all the sights,
I was at all the gatherings, I knew all the women. I thought to myself,
what a fine figure I was making in the world."<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The boys were not overburdened with parental solicitude.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"My mother was good-natured and
indulgent, and a clever woman; our escapades did not induce her to
interfere with our habits."<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The annoyance came from another quarter.
The boys had a tutor, who is described with the true d'Argenson stroke
as "fou, imbécile, ignorant, libertin, et hypocrite;"<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> one of those
persons who, when you have executed some very bad drawings and love
them very dearly, will vent his spleen by tearing them up.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> It became
too much for mortal endurance; and when one day the tutor "advanced
upon his desk," the boy received him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
with doubled fists.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> From that time forward d'Argenson went his way in peace; and the
little rake's progress was proceeding apace, when it was overtaken
by one of those strokes of destiny which it is equally impossible
to foresee and to resist.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>He was sent to school.</p>

<p>In 1709, at the age of fifteen, he went with his brother to the Jesuit
College of Louis-le-Grand, which had become, under the patronage of the
Great King, the most fashionable of French public schools.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Thither,
thirty years later, he was followed by another d'Argenson&mdash;one who,
in the fulness of time and the sunshine of circumstance, was to leave
a record, not of maimed and weary aspiration, but of rapid, resolute
achievement&mdash;Anne Robert Jacques Turgot. But the lad was busied
with other thoughts. From "a man of the world who could count his
conquests,"<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
he had dwindled to the compass of a mere schoolboy; and
his heart was heavy over his fallen state. Occasionally the boys acted
tragedies at the College; and as d'Argenson sat in the amphitheatre,
pilloried in his hateful gown, a glimpse of some fair spectator whom he
had known in happier days would cover him with unutterable shame.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
But he had the tenacity of purpose which distinguished his race; his
time would come; and the modest treasure he was able to amass from the
savings of his pocket-money, was dissipated upon those rare occasions
when he could shake off the class-room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
dust from his feet, and plume himself in the great
world again. "Why," he asks, with that strange recurrent smile of his,
"why should one laugh at such an ambition? Surely it is upon the same
canvas that that of conquerors is built (bâtie)!"<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> He possessed that
keen, yet kindly humour of the man who knows himself, and can laugh at
himself, without ceasing to be himself.</p>

<p>One incident in his school career he never forgot. It began with
pea-shooters, and ended with a tragedy. One morning, as the venerable
professor of rhetoric, Père Lejay,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> entered the class-room, he was
received with a raking fire of peas. The culprit platoon consisted of
the Duc de Boufflers, Count d'Argenson, and his faithful apparitor,
Marc Pierre. Boufflers received a flogging, and died from the effect
of it. His father was only a duke. But when it came to the sons of M.
d'Argenson, the retributive rod was stayed by the timely remembrance
of that dark and dangerous person: Jesuitical discretion came into
play,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and the youthful malefactors escaped. It is curious that the
brothers should have lived, the one to be the powerful patron of the
Jesuits, the other to attack them, for the eyes of posterity, with a
weapon which carries further than a "Sarbacane."</p>

<p>But the young Count d'Argenson was not long to trouble the repose of
his spiritual task-masters. He was to complete his education in another
school, deemed no less necessary to the training
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of the whole and perfect man. From the sallow austerity of the reverend fathers, with their hard
beds and their unspeakable soup, he passed to the gracious converse of ladies'
society, where knowledge was savoured with a joyous sweetness,
and where the rewards of success were great indeed. Dreaming long
afterwards of the year 1712 and of the gallantries of that golden age,
he sighs regretfully over the hearts that fell, and over those that
might have fallen had the siege been pressed.</p>

<p>"What a fool I was not to have profited by them! I have repented at
leisure."<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A votary of pleasure, he was never its slave; and an event was
approaching which was soon to engage him in the more sober interests of
life. On the morning of September 1st, 1715, the eyelids of the Grand
Monarque closed upon a long and fateful chapter in French history;
and the hearts of men beat high again with the generous hopes of a
newer time. France, and the humblest of her children, d'Argenson, had
reached the parting of the ways. The "epic of royalty"<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> was over;
the epic of revolution was about to begin. In the development of the
drama d'Argenson was to bear a modest, but no mean part. He was now
twenty-one. The time for dreaming had passed away; the time for action
was at hand. On the threshold of his career, we may pause to gather up
those early half-conscious political impressions, which, in the case of
quick-minded men, have a real, if only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
half-recognised, influence upon the direction of future thought.</p>

<p>He had been but a boy of eight when great events occurred.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> We can
well imagine with what childish pleasure he must have watched the
stirring of the troops in Paris on the renewal of the great War; and
the wide-eyed wonderment with which he may have heard how an army of
France was cutting down French citizens for the pleasure of those
great black men, whom every one laughed with and called abbé; and how
everybody said that one Cavalier was as brave as he was beautiful, and
that he and the like of him should have been at Blenheim! And then,
as he grew in wit, the excitement of boyhood may have been clouded,
if ever so little, by the growing desolation, as defeat followed upon
disaster. He could remember how haggard men began to cry for bread;
until at last, in 1709, the stones of Paris rose in mutiny, and his own
father, the Chief of Police, went in fear of his life.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> And through
it all there was no comfort, but only men said that this Great King had
been too great, that he had aroused the alarm of Europe, and that at
last Europe had turned to bay. And then when the peace had come, and
the people were beginning to breathe, Jesuit and Jansenist reopened
their feud and reviled each other in the name of God; while d'Argenson
suspected, what his friend Arouet and the wits who supped with the
Grand Prior disdainfully averred,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> that there was no truth to be
found upon either side, but only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
arrogant unspirituality. And now the King, great though he had been, had gone the way of little
men; and the hearts of his own people rejoiced, even as the nations
whom he had humbled in the dust.</p>

<p>D'Argenson never forgot those fatal years. They haunted his memory and
moulded his thought; and he could realise the gravity of the course
before him, when, in 1716, he began his career as a councillor of the
Parlement of Paris. Shortly afterwards, he received his first official
appointment as Director of the Press.</p>

<p>As yet he had excited no great hopes. His father saw but little of him,
and was inclined to regard him as rather a fool; the paternal hopes
were centred upon his brother, the pleasing, popular and imposing Marc
Pierre, then a young man of twenty. This unhappy partiality left a
fatal mark upon the character of the elder son; and though d'Argenson
never speaks of his father but with affection and respect,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> he cannot
disguise how deeply he felt it. And yet, it is curious to remember,
he was before all things else his father's son. He inherited from him
his passion for work;<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> to him he owed that instinctive regard for
"le bien public,"<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> which afterwards ripened into absolute devotion;
from him he drew that soundness of heart and incisiveness of mind which
are d'Argenson's prime distinction as a thinker and a man. But there
was another strand in the stout complexity of the father's nature,
something which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
had led him, when he came to Paris, to shun the
companionship of the great, and to seek his pleasure in a self-chosen
society of the baser sort,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> which had surrounded his life with
the infernal obscurity of a magician's cell,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> something of
self-sufficience, of self-contentment, self-concentration. That too,
for his own confusion, d'Argenson had inherited. It might have remained
harmless; but nourished by his father's indifference and neglect, it
grew with the rankness of a noxious weed. He came to find comfort in
his own society. As his own company became dearer to him, so did the
distance widen between himself and his fellows. Alone, he could be
natural, forceful, even great at times; in society, he was pursued by
a haunting self-distrust, which attracted disparagement and very often
ridicule. As yet, it is true, beyond a touch of depreciation here and
there,<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> we see very little of it; the energy of youth and his own
strength of will enabled him to fight with his misfortune. But it had
afflicted him with one disability which no effort, however determined,
could overcome. It had rendered him for ever incapable of coping with
the blatancy, the loud insistence, the insensate, trumpet-tongued
vulgarity, with which every man of affairs is called upon to deal; and
he relates an incident in his present experience as Director of the
Press which shows that he was as helpless in the face of it now as he
afterwards proved in the more august circle of the Council of State. He
was arranging some matter with Machault,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
was then in charge of the police; his colleague was
for carrying things off with a high hand; d'Argenson laid down his pen,
looked at the man, rose, and retired from the business.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> It was an
act of weakness, but the weakness was invincible.</p>

<p>In spite of it, and of those defects of manner which led others
to hold him in such scant esteem, there was one person who
believed in d'Argenson, his aunt, Charlotte Emilie de Caumartin,
Marquise de Balleroy. In one of the earlier letters of that famous
correspondence<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> in which most of the materials for his life at this
period are preserved, he tries to excuse his slackness in the friendly
office of literary purveyor. "If I am not sending you any books," he
writes (March 23, 1717), "it is not for want of will. I have brought
misfortune on the Press. My censorial severity is silencing all our
authors." There were more solid reasons for the unwonted lull in the
activity of the Press Bureau.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> There were no authors to silence. The
literary efflorescence of the Grand Age was long since dead; while the
new spirit, which was to be so fruitful in trouble to d'Argenson's
successors, was only fermenting beneath the surface. It made its
appearance with the "Lettres Persanes," which came&mdash;from Holland&mdash;in
1721. The Censor was not even made the tool of a political party. It is
true that the battle of the "Constitution"<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> was raging as fiercely as
ever; but Madame de Maintenon had disappeared, and it was no concern of
Philippe d'Orléans. When the Government at last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
interfered (by declaration of October 7, 1717),<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
it was to proscribe the publications of both parties. It is very
clear, and it is worth remarking, that d'Argenson was in entire accord
with the policy of the Regent. His father, still in command of the
police, was constantly behind the scenes, and was under no illusion
as to the character of the actors.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> He used to tell Marais that
"if the Jansenists were rogues, the Jesuits were as bad, and that he
held the proofs with regard to both of them."<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The attitude of the
son may readily be guessed. His one desire was for peace. In a letter
to the Marquise (April 2, 1717) he describes a political brochure by
one of her friends as "too bad to read, and not silly enough to laugh
at. The Abbé de Guitaut had no reason to write that he detested the
Constitution, and he had every reason to refrain from publishing his
letter."<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> In short, he viewed the controversy with much concern, and
the "Constitution" with none whatever.</p>

<p>Another question was coming to the front, which touched him more
nearly as parliamentary councillor (Conseiller au Parlement). The Bank
was flourishing, and in August, 1717, the Mississippi Company was
successfully floated.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> On the 2nd of September d'Argenson writes a
letter:&mdash;</p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our Court of Parlement has received a scurvy compliment." It was
a question of money, and they "desired explanations." The Regent
replied "that it would be a strange thing if the factious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
opposition of the Parlement were to arrest the course of those
advantageous measures which he wished to secure for the public;
that we had no right to meddle with matters of finance; and that
he would not suffer the royal authority to be made light of so
long as it were entrusted to his care."<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>He appears to be recording the first brush between the forces of the
Parlement and of the Crown, and the opening of the hot battle which
ended, exactly three years later (August 28, 1720), at Pontoise.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
The young councillor was soon to be even more deeply interested in
the progress of events. Five months afterwards (January 28, 1718) his
father became Warden of the Seals, and President of the Council of
Finance; and it was soon plain, from the threatening attitude of the
Parlement, that their redoubtable enemy had not entered the ministry
one moment too soon. For the present, indeed, the Government was
content to hold its hand; for Dubois, the demon of the play, had not
yet returned from London, where he was sedulously wooing the Hanoverian
interest.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> As for d'Argenson, his heart wavered 'twixt love for his
father and loyalty to his brethren of the long robe. He had recourse
to argument&mdash;for the Marquis was by this time impressed with his son's
substantial worth.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> "A tout ce que je lui exposai" the black-bearded
minister had but one reply: "My good fellow! that Parlement of yours,
has it any troops? For our part, we have 150,000 men!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
That's what it all comes to." "Et voilà parler en
grand homme!" exclaims his son,<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>with an admiration which is the more
natural for its inconsistency. But the "grand homme" was preparing
to act. On August 16th Dubois arrived in Paris bearing a treaty of
alliance with England; and the great <i>coup d'état</i> which crushed the
pretensions of the Parlement and silenced the opposition to Law,
followed upon the 26th.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>In December d'Argenson married,<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and cast about for the means to
feather his nest. Retiring discomfited from the Palais de Justice, he
took refuge, like many an irate but thrifty parliamentarian, in the
Rue Quincampoix. In November, 1719, when the tide of elation was in
full flood and trembling on the ebb, we hear that d'Argenson "is in for
(y est pour) 500,000 livres."<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Three weeks afterwards, by decree of
the 1st of December, the Bank and the Treasury refuse to receive cash.
Before the end of the year the shares are falling.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> On the 3rd of
January M. d'Argenson withdraws from the control of the finances; on
the 5th, Law takes the helm as Controller-General, and proceeds with
the series of desperate decrees designed to save the credit of the
Bank.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Upon one of the commissions which followed in quick succession
d'Argenson was appointed<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> to serve as Master of Requests.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> He could
do so with a light heart. Warned in time, he had managed to extricate
himself; and in a letter of the 22nd of February, 1720, we read:
"Talking of shares, no one is coming off more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
prettily than M. d'Argenson <i>l'aîné</i>; he has just
completed the purchase of an estate on the Réveillon road; it is his
principal acquisition."<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile he had obtained a provision of another kind. The Warden of
the Seals, on withdrawing in January from the control of the finances,
had managed, with his usual dexterity, to cover his retreat. Directly
afterwards, to the no small scandal of St. Simon,<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> the young
Chevalier was entrusted with the Lieutenancy of Police, while the elder
brother, Count d'Argenson, received a seat at the Council of State,
with an immediate promise of the Intendancy of Maubeuge. Thus it was
that about the middle of March,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> 1720, d'Argenson set out for his
seat of government at Valenciennes, leaving Paris to face the appalling
ruin created by the crash of the great "System." Though removed from
the centre of the drama, a place was reserved for him in the final act.
On the 21st of May appeared the suicidal decree which shattered what
vestige of credit remained. It was inspired by d'Argenson's father,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
and cost him the seals. He fell in the beginning of June. In July Law's
carriage was wrecked under the very windows of the Regent in the court
of the Palais Royal. In December the great adventurer took to flight;
and Count d'Argenson had the supreme satisfaction of arresting him at
Valenciennes, and, by an order from Paris, detaining his jewel case,
the last resource of the broken man.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Personally the young Intendant
has not much reason to complain. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
"System" had left him with the valuable property
of Réveillon; he was already a Councillor of State; and at the age of
twenty-six he was comfortably established at Valenciennes as the chief
magistrate of the important frontier province of Hainaut.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I am sure I shall entreat you so much that you will come here; my
house is not at all bad; it is scarcely in order, but you will find it
even better than they usually are. An opera is coming to Valenciennes;
we have very pretty lansquenet, ombre, picquet&mdash;you get plenty of that
in the country<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>&mdash;quadrille and even brélan; a carriage; this summer
your choice of drives, if you wish to see a country quite new to you,
the towns in the environs. In a word, what shall I tell you? You will
see people who love you very much, though I am speaking of one who
does not know you yet, but for whom I bespeak your friendship."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this letter, a few weeks after his arrival, when the house-warming is
complete, d'Argenson commends himself, his establishment and his young
wife, to his trusted and right loyal friend, Madame de Balleroy. We may
glance for an instant at this remarkable lady. At the age of nineteen,
by a marriage with a country nobleman, she was widowed of the bright
buoyancy of life at Paris; and amid the flat fields and uneventful
hedgerows of Normandy<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>, her heart yearned for the patter of the
distant pavement. Her forlorn beauty, her wasted wit, drew round her a
little army of friends, held faithful by the affectionate discipline of
pity;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and in the goodly company of correspondents
who reflect for her the gaieties of the Regency,<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> not the least
honourable place is held by her nephew d'Argenson.</p>

<p>Certain features which his letters disclose must be brought for a
moment into relief. In the first place, he shows himself a devoted
friend and a dutiful correspondent; in the latter regard he is a
shining example to his brilliant young brother.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, we occasionally come across a story, which, if we forget the
manners of the time, it seems as strange that a gentleman should have
been able to write as that a lady should been willing to read. Yet it
is comforting to find, in reading such passages, that if there is an
utter absence of delicacy or reserve, there is an equal freedom from
mere smirking prurience; the man's breath is tainted by the fashion of
the time, but at least his heart is whole.</p>

<p>Sometimes again d'Argenson's feeling for the ideal, which explains so
many of amiable vagaries, is seen taking wing and soaring away to the
sound of his own laughter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p> "I mean my bust (February 18, 1718<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>) to be
in the library of Balleroy, with that of Pico de la Mirandola, and some
great personage or other who, after all, could do no more than read.
The proposal, perhaps, is not very reasonable as yet;<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> of the two, I
am more like the latter."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In one letter we get a glimpse of d'Argenson's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
most cherished interior, and so of the man who loved it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I assure you, Rouillon (Réveillon) is becoming a fine house. In a
gallery on the wing will be my library, with a little reading-room at
one end, plenty of desks, sofas, cushions, upholstery in morocco&mdash;all
the novelties of Holland; and from the windows a vista of avenues,
kitchen gardens, woods, meadows, sheep. Won't you be charmed with it
when you are at Paris this summer?" (August 8, 1722).<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His occasional reference to "le cadet" is interesting, in the light
of their subsequent relations. With a touch of good-natured envy
he remarks, "My brother is surpassing himself as Chief of Police.
He is a perfect courtier; in that regard he has nothing to learn"
(August 8, 1722).<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>Perhaps indeed the most precious thing about
these letters is the light they throw upon the real character of the
younger brother, and on d'Argenson's subsequent portrait of him. A
comparison of the young "Chevalier" who writes over his own signature,
with the eternal "Mon Frère" of d'Argenson's Journal, enables us to
estimate the personal equation in d'Argenson's political criticism. It
tends to suggest that the impression of high colouring, exaggeration,
unfairness, which is left by the perusal of many of his more trenchant
pages, is due, not to the intrinsic falsity of his judgments, but to
the violence and heat with which they are pronounced. We see that to
many of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
indictments the question, "Well! what of it? how
could he help it?" would have been at least a valid reply; and we
suspect that had d'Argenson judged his own contemporaries with that
same deep-sounding charity which, after a century and a half, one can
claim no credit for applying to himself, we should have been spared
much of that bitterness which he expends so lavishly upon the men of
his time, and above all upon his brother, Count d'Argenson. So far as
one can see, the truth was this. Marc Pierre was his mother's son,
the blood of the Caumartins in every vein.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> In him the rough-hewn
strength of the d'Argenson character was fashioned to a form of
lightness and grace; and losing in massiveness, it gained in charm.
He had his father's strength without his seriousness; his power of
work without his love of it. He impressed his contemporaries<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> by his
singular union of facile effectiveness with absolute unconcern. Such
a passage as this, which appears in a letter of 1715,<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> needed no
signature for identification.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"At last, my dear aunt, the taxes are achieving what all the preachers
in the world have never dared to undertake. Luxury is no more. The
balls of the Opera and Comedy are as deserted as the ante-chamber of
M. Desmarets or M. de Pontchartrain.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The churches are rather more
patronised than they were; there, for example, you see men of business
who have not yet been taxed, praying, at the foot of the altar, for a
lot more pleasant than has fallen to their companions; you see poor Molinists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
beside themselves at the triumph
of their adversaries, and sighing for the re-establishment of Jesuit
influence. There you see many a young girl in tears, sorrowing for the
purse of the financier who used to keep her in such gay profusion, and
crying out upon the harshness of the powers that be at present, who
work to construct their own fortunes before taking thought for that of
their mistresses. Even me you see there now and again, vastly puzzled
as to where I shall dine or sup, and turned pious for want of something
better to do."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After reading such a passage as this, a new light breaks upon one of
the first notices of Count d'Argenson that appear in the Journal, and
upon a thousand more that follow at intervals for nearly thirty years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It is certainly true that my brother has not the secret of attaching

principal cause; it lays him open to the charge of insincerity in

</blockquote>

<p>It is here, in this "distraction," implicit in every
line of that youthful letter, that we touch the real foundation for
those continual charges of cold cleverness, absence of principle,
paltriness of aim, pettiness of means, with which Count d'Argenson is
pursued. It was this that divided the brothers with a severance of
interest that nothing could bridge. At the outset of life their roads
diverged. The one led to greatness through labyrinths of littleness;
the other was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
way of honest, impotent, disdainful obscurity. The simple
truth was that the younger brother, keen, accomplished, utterly
careless, was free to choose the pleasanter of the two; for the elder,
it was barred from the beginning. His estrangement from the world had
wholly unfitted him for the arts of complaisance and intrigue; and
there was something within him which protested that they were as far
beneath him as they were beyond his reach. D'Argenson went his own way;
he found that it led nowhither. He was to learn that without those arts
which he coveted and despised, devotion, disinterestedness, were no
passport to power; yet, it is good to reflect, he would never consent
to lose his devotion in the ignobler interests of a private life. When
the last word is said, it may be found that of the two brothers it
was he who had chosen the better part; and that if, in spite of him,
knowledge and justice require us to count small blame to the one, we
may ascribe with equal heartiness all honour to the other.</p>

<p>This in anticipation; for d'Argenson is still at Valenciennes, without
a thought that the unlikeness of character revealed in these letters to
Madame de Balleroy will ever lead to open estrangement.</p>

<p>It was about the middle of March, 1720, that d'Argenson took over
his province. He left behind him at Paris at least one person who
would watch his career with lively interest. In 1718, in the salon
of Madame de Lambert, he had been introduced to a man, whose recent
expulsion from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
French Academy for some shrewd criticisms of the
late reign had given him credit among the younger spirits&mdash;the Abbé
de St. Pierre.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> We can easily imagine how d'Argenson must have been
attracted to a man, who had his own breadth and generosity of mind, and
who was crippled like himself by the lack of those social arts which
would have secured for his opinions a perilous respect. The regard
appears to have been mutual; and when d'Argenson made his first venture
in public life, it was under the auspices of the utopian abbé. A letter
which survives, addressed by him to the Intendant of Valenciennes,<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
is alone sufficient to suggest the influence which inspired d'Argenson
with his political philosophy.</p>

<p>St. Pierre encourages him to attempt a reform in the distribution of
the taille; and incidentally he remarks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Those states are the best governed where justice between individuals
is most exactly observed; there the people are more prosperous than
elsewhere. It were to be desired that there were never favours to hope
for from a minister, but only justice for which to apply to him; for it
is seldom that favour to one is not injustice to another."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He concludes his letter with the words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I have a great desire to be able to watch your new government, and I
expect your success will soon persuade plenty of people besides myself
that you are worthy of high office."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That d'Argenson, from the point of view of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Government at least, was successful, there is
little reason to doubt. The chief features of his administration may be
lightly reviewed. In addition to his work of routine as superintendent
"de justice, police, et finance," he kept an intelligent watch for
the appearance of abuses, and also for possibilities of reform. His
province, on the frontier of Flanders, involved him in duties of a
"military even more than of a judicial or financial character."<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
The condition of the troops engaged his attention; he early discovered
that "the army contractors are great rascals," and that the men were
being defrauded of a part of their rations; he introduced a reform
which was afterwards adopted throughout the French army, and for which
he is careful to claim the credit.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> In another direction he showed
the liberal tendencies which afterwards distinguished him. In time of
abundance, he permitted the exportation of corn, and derived a useful
revenue from the sale of the license.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> In the same connection too,
he succeeded with much address in averting one of the periodical bread
panics which were caused by the restrictions on the interchange of
corn.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> With a pitiful regard for the soldiers and the common people,
he had a formidable hatred of knaves in authority. Having disposed of
the "fraudulent contractors," he turned his attention to "quelques
coquins de bourgeois," who availed themselves of the custom of
extending the term of municipal tenure upon great occasions, to enjoy
their offices at the expense of their fellow citizens. He took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the opportunity of the consecration of Louis XV. at Rheims&mdash;at which, by the way, d'Argenson himself was present<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>&mdash;to post a proclamation
"at all the cross-roads of my towns," requiring the elections to
proceed as usual.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> In short, he went to work in such a way as to open
the eyes of his oldest friends to the real ability concealed behind
his unpromising exterior.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> But with all his success, he had good
reason to be dissatisfied with his position. He had escaped with great
luck at the beginning of the Mississippi crash,<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> but before it was
over he was badly hit. His father-in-law, M. Méliand, Intendant of
Lille, "had been kind enough" to remit his wife's dowry in Bank notes
at a time when the notes were only useful as waste paper.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> There
were other disappointments in store for him. In May, 1721, his father
died. The old man, regarding the Chevalier, now to be the Count, as
the real hope of his family, had bequeathed to him the whole of his
personal property, leaving the Marquis d'Argenson burdened with the
family estates.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Moreover, M. Méliand showed no disposition to retire
in his favour from the rich Intendancy at Lille, for which d'Argenson
had naturally hoped;<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> and meanwhile, his own establishment at
Valenciennes was involving him in expenses which he was ill prepared
to meet. In the midst of these embarrassments an event occurred which
seemed to open a prospect of escape. To explain it, a slight retrospect
will be necessary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>
<p>Shortly after his marriage, and about a year before leaving Paris, he
had formed an intimacy with a Madame de G&mdash;&mdash;,<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> whom we recognise
from his description of her as "sincere, affectionate, faithful,
reasonable, and generous," as a type of those virtues which d'Argenson
especially loved, and of which he was inclined to suspect the absence
in women generally, and in his own wife in particular. Madame de
G&mdash;&mdash; had a cousin, the wife of the Ambassador to Sardinia. In the
winter of 1719, this lady returned from Turin, without visible means
of subsistence. But there was always a royal road to affluence open
to bankrupt ladies-of-fortune, and with no unnecessary delay Madame
de Prie was "administered"<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> to that libidinous dyspeptic, the Duc
de Bourbon. Shortly afterwards, "we"&mdash;that is, M. le Duc, Mesdames de
Prie et de G&mdash;&mdash;, and young d'Argenson were "en partie carrée"; at
last the dream of his youthful years was realised, and d'Argenson was
able to make a fine figure as an intimate of "the first prince of the
blood."<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The "Partie" was broken up by d'Argenson's departure for
Valenciennes, and it lingered in his mind merely as a pleasant memory.
He was soon to recall it with more lively concern. At the end of
November, 1723, business called him to Paris. On the day of his return,
he had an interview with the Regent, and remarked how ill he looked.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
On the following evening, at Valenciennes, he was standing by the
chimney corner talking to a friend when a courier was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
announced. It was the 3rd of December: d'Orléans
was dead. We can well imagine with what feelings d'Argenson must have
heard that his illustrious patron of the "Partie carrée" had become
the ruler of France, and that a lady who had already offered him
"les dernières faveurs,"<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> had succeeded to the footstool of Madame
de Parabère. Evidently it was not at Valenciennes that the golden
eggs were going to be laid. Moreover, his brother was for the second
time chief of the Parisian police;<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> he had lately been appointed
Chancellor of the Orléans household; in a word, he could be of infinite
service. If any doubts remained as to the wisdom of his course, they
were dispelled by a letter<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> from his uncle, the Marquis de Balleroy,
advising him to use no delay in taking his place at the Council of
State. His mind was made up; and on the 28th of December, 1723, he
wrote to M. le Duc, resigning the Intendancy of Hainaut.</p>

<p>Eight days afterwards (January 4, 1724), he writes to Madame de
Balleroy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I have said goodbye to the provincial dignity. Thank heaven!
Thank heaven!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But d'Argenson had not more reason to thank heaven than
usual. He soon discovered that, with all his masterly calculation,
it was the worst thing he could have done. His brother had not found
favour in the eyes of Madame de Prie;<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> and as chancellor of the House
of Orléans, he was not acceptable to M. le Duc.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> The latter, so far
from welcoming d'Argenson to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Council of State, was simply incensed at his
untimely resignation;<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> it may even have been this that decided him
to dismiss Count d'Argenson from the Lieutenancy of Police immediately
afterwards. In fact, we have here a first glimpse of one side of
d'Argenson's nature, which we shall meet continually in more august, if
not to him more important, affairs. He was endowed with a conceptive
faculty of the first order; it is the breadth, the intimate grasp
of his conceptions, with the complex character behind them, that
constitute his enduring claim to remembrance. But he had the attendant
weakness of the man of many devices, an eager, unquestioning faith in
the efficacy of his own plans; and upon that rock his fortunes were
continually splitting. His power of combination and his belief in his
own strategy were constantly leading him into precipitate action, and
involving him in difficulties against which a man of more sluggish
imagination and narrower mind would never have had even to guard. It
was not that his strategy was weak; it was generally powerful, and
often profound; but the moment it left his study, it became stiff,
useless, and often ridiculous, for want of those small political and
social arts which his brother possessed to perfection. We can easily
imagine the course which that brother would have taken had he been in
d'Argenson's place. He would have addressed to M. le Duc a delightful
letter of congratulation, reminding him playfully of the old days of
the "Part Carrée," and closing with protestations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
renewed zeal for his service. He would then have
spent the next six months in finding or contriving, honestly or
otherwise, a pretext for at once returning to Paris and gratifying his
powerful patron. Unhappily such a course was too slow and small and
politic for d'Argenson's temperament; his resignation was disastrous;
and as chance would have it, it was nearly twenty years before the
brothers recovered the ground they now lost. Certainly, in d'Argenson's
case at least, it was not for want of effort. After a few months at
the Council, he discovered that there were "too few opportunities of
serving the public in this business of judge, where one has scarcely
a vote for the thirtieth part of a decree."<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> The Intendancy of
Paris became vacant; he tried to obtain it; but Madame de Prie was
inexorable, and the appointment was refused.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"As for me, I was good for nothing. I was merely an old friend,
who had been good enough to be unwilling to take advantage of her
kindness."<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We shall meet again with this amiable weakness for
explaining his failures by reasons which are less correct than they
are complimentary to himself. Even yet he did not give up hope. His
marriage with Mademoiselle Méliand had given him a right to expect the
reversion of the Intendancy of Lille.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> He now tried to arrange for
its transference to him; but M. Méliand drove a hard bargain and the
negotiation fell through.</p>

<p>We now reach one of the turning-points in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
d'Argenson's life. Never was a man more commendably
eager to distinguish himself, to play his part in the world, and to
preserve an honourable name in honour by contributing his share towards
the "Bien Public." He now saw himself, chiefly through his own lack of
patient adroitness, banished to the obscurity of private life. He found
misfortune a stern mistress, but her lessons were as worth learning as
they were hard to learn. It was indeed at this time of disappointment
that his mind became imbued with what is rarest and greatest in his
political thought. While his brother, in the Orléans household, strove,
by all the arts of which he was a master, to win his way back to power,
d'Argenson withdrew entirely from the scene. He called to mind the
words of his father, that "a lofty and ambitious man will have all or
nothing;" and, in M. Aubertin's phrase, he became content with nothing
that he might have all. For some years we hear nothing of him; it is
only in 1731 that he again appears upon the scene under the protection
of the minister Chauvelin.</p>

<p>His life in the interval must be reserved for another chapter. In
the present, but one word remains to be said; it is perhaps the most
important of all.</p>

<p>We are already in a position to appreciate d'Argenson as of a
peculiarly complex nature; and its complexity is the more puzzling
from the fact that the sterling ore of character is combined with
traits, not of wickedness, but of weakness. He possesses in abundance
those qualities which men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
love and admire; and yet we scarcely become
intimately acquainted with him upon any single occasion without being
tempted to laughter. The reason is only too clear. His real loftiness
of spirit is yoked with a kind of halting timidity, with which the
unhappy experience of his earlier years had afflicted him; and for such
a man, to be sublime was too often to appear ridiculous. Occasionally
amusement deepens to an even less pleasant feeling; for he held, and
he had a right to hold, strong opinions upon men and things; and he
sometimes records them in terms so unmeasured as to awaken sympathy
with his unheard opponents and to arouse suspicion as regards himself.
Moreover, he is himself so simply ingenuous as not to understand
the necessity of discreet suppression; and he pursues, with painful
circumstance, those moods of irritation, disappointment, disillusion,
those momentary vices of temper, which all men perhaps are small enough
to feel, but few are great enough to be able to record. Such failings
might be taken for what they are worth&mdash;which is very little&mdash;were it
not that, magnified out of all proportion by some of d'Argenson's most
influential critics, they have been made the basis for conceptions of
his character which are too ungenerous to be critically just. Faults
they are, undoubtedly; but in reading, day after day, the revelations
of his Journal, one feels that in this man, with all his failings,
there is something verily great; and that morally, he towers above the
ready cox-combs who laughed at him while he lived, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
who have sneered at his memory when it alone remained.</p>

<p>It is, then, with keen curiosity that one seeks for something which
will explain this persistent faith in d'Argenson, nor is the quest in
vain. Here and there among the pages of his Journal, buried amid much
that is ephemeral and often worthless, one comes across passages which
are perfect gems of feeling and expression. They show us d'Argenson
at his best, and enable us to divine what is best in him. Among the
first hundred pages there are at least three such episodes standing
out in fine relief. One is the tale of the parrot that troubled the
repose of the Intendant of Hainaut.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Another, even more charming
and suggestive, is the story of Kakouin, the pet boar which was given
him by St. Contest, his friend of the Entresol, and which came to
such an untimely end.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Read in the light of many that follow, these
pages reveal such a perfect beauty of heart, such a faultlessness of
emotional touch, as is as rare as it is lovely; they spring, pure and
clear, from the depths of the man's soul, wholly undarkened by that
turgidity of feeling to which the enthusiasm of humanity afterwards
gave birth.</p>

<p>It was not alone to the pets of his own household that d'Argenson's
heart was given. There was room in it left for the "brutes" of La
Bruyère, "whose faces, when they rose upon their feet, were as the
faces of men." One day, in the year 1725, he travelled four leagues to
the village of Sezanne,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
through which the young Queen, Maria Leczinska,
was to pass on her entry into France. His account of what he saw there
forms the third of those pictures of this date which enable us to
penetrate to the heart of the man, and to follow him afterwards with an
unfailing respect. In the course of the narrative he says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The harvest and the crops of all sorts were in danger of perishing;
they could not be gathered for the continual rains; the poor labourer
was looking out for a moment of dry weather in order to get them in.
Yet for all that this whole district was beaten with several scourges.
The peasants had been carried off to put the roads by which the Queen
was to pass into fit condition; and they were only the worse, so much
so that Her Majesty often thought she would drown; they had to drag
her from her carriage by main force as they could. In several places
she and her suite were swimming in the water, which lay over the
whole country, and that in spite of the infinite pains expended by a
tyrannical ministry."<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And further on he says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In the evening, after supper, I went for a stroll round the
market-place of Sezanne. For a moment the rain had ceased. I spoke to
some poor peasants, who had their horses with them, attached to the
tail of a cart, and standing in the night without provender. Some of
them told me that their horses had had nothing to eat for three days.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
They were harnessing ten in the place of four;
judge how much of them remained!"<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One can scarcely pretend, by fragments of translation, to convey even a
shade of the impression produced by these whole passages, and by many
that deserve to stand beside them. After reading them, and allowing
them to leaven and lighten one's whole conception of d'Argenson's
character, it is with keen pleasure we meet with a luminous remark in
the pages of one of his most accomplished critics:</p>

<p>"C'est par le c&oelig;ur, en effet, que son esprit est grand," says M.
Aubertin;<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and it is the happiest word that has been devoted to
d'Argenson.</p>

<p>We have but to accept it, and we are enabled to remit to their due
place those small distempers, those accidents of the inauspicious
moment, which have often hardened the regard of criticism; we see how
very little they appear by the side of what was greatest and best in
d'Argenson. Qualities are virtuous in proportion as they are necessary;
and events have thrown a suggestive light upon the relative value
of the various virtues in the France of the Eighteenth Century. We
see that there was something more real and rare than those elegant
adornments, those small dexterities, which were then so dearly prized:
that they afford but thin subsistence for a society bereft of honesty,
devotion, depth of vision, and soundness of heart. Those qualities
d'Argenson possessed, and the children of this world laughed at him.
Their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
generation does not last for ever; and we, who are on the hither side
of 1793, may be excused for thinking that, with all
the failings that whetted their wit, there were very few among them
who could be mentioned in a breath with the man they honoured by their
laughter.</p>

<p>D'Argenson could feel, but he was no sentimentalist. The years which he
now passed in obscurity were among the happiest and most fruitful of
his life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the influences which connected d'Argenson with the tradition
of the late reign were his relations with that curious and not very
admirable person,<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> the Abbé de Choisy. It would appear that during
the closing years of his life the harlequin abbé was on terms of some
intimacy with his young relative;<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and shortly before his death in
1724, he placed in d'Argenson's hands a collection of manuscripts,<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
from which the published remains of de Choisy are principally
derived.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Among them was a record which d'Argenson might recall with
a certain melancholy interest.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> It seems that in 1692, de Choisy's
rooms at the Luxembourg became the headquarters of a little company
of thirteen men, among whom were Fontenelle and Perrault, and others
distinguished in literature and society.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> They met for discussions upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
politics, theology, and moral science, and in
fact all those questions of more pressing and immediate concern which
the constitution of the three existing Academies ignored. It may
well be imagined that such an organisation could scarcely commend
itself to the favour of the Monarch who, a few years afterwards,
was to break the heart of Vauban; and before a year had passed, the
Academy of the Luxembourg came to an untimely end. The collapse was
natural enough, for these were the palmy days of the older <i>régime</i>;
its vices were still to be revealed, and as yet the discussion of
political subjects by unauthorised persons might well have seemed an
impertinence. Thirty years after, the matter had assumed a different
aspect. Disasters abroad and miseries at home, which had stirred
the patriotism of Vauban, the ferment created by the advent of the
Regency, the widespread concern for questions of administration aroused
by the rise and fall of the great "System," and, lastly, the object
lesson in political fatuity afforded by the ministry of the Duc de
Bourbon, all contributed to raise matters of government to a place of
primary interest; and it is not surprising that about a year after
the publication of the "Lettres Persanes," a serious and successful
attempt should have been made to organise and define political thought.
In 1722 the Abbé Alary invited a number of gentlemen connected with
the administrative and diplomatic services to meet in his rooms in
an entresol in the Place Vendôme, which became for about eight years
the home of the memorable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
"Club de l'Entresol." The idea of this,
the first of French political societies, was probably suggested by
Bolingbroke, an intimate friend of Alary, who may have hoped to find,
in a little cabinet of embryo statesmen, some mild consolation for his
banishment from Whitehall. Certain it is that the English politician
did much to give it a successful start; and a year afterwards (July,
1723) we find him writing to the perpetual president, Alary:<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"You will give my kind regards to our little Academy. If I were not
sure of seeing them again next month, I should be quite miserable. They
have confirmed my taste for philosophy; they have revived my old love
for literature; how grateful I am to them!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1725, upwards of a year after his return from Valenciennes,
d'Argenson became a member of the Entresol;<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> and some time afterwards
he had the honour of introducing a man whose whole life was devoted
to insisting upon the paramount importance of political concerns&mdash;his
friend and master, the Abbé de St. Pierre.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>It is a curious fact that the man who received the record of the
ill-starred society of the Luxembourg should have become the historian
of its successor; for it is from d'Argenson that our knowledge of the
Entresol is mainly derived. Several years after its suppression, he
sat down to record his reminiscences of "a little organisation, whose
history, at present unknown to many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
people, will soon be forgotten by all the
world."<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Events are grouped very differently by the redressing hand
of time, and, apart from the interest attaching to it in connection
with the life of d'Argenson, the Entresol is in no danger of being
forgotten.</p>

<p>Its meetings<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> were held on Saturday evenings, and lasted from five
o'clock till eight. The time was spent in the recital of political
news, conversation on passing events, the reading of papers, and open
discussion. The procedure, though carefully ordered, was sufficiently
elastic, and on extraordinary occasions&mdash;as when His Excellency Horace
Walpole appeared to advocate the maintenance of the understanding
with England<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>&mdash;might be entirely suspended. Not the least useful
member of the Entresol was d'Argenson himself; he joined in its
labours with his usual industry and zeal. He made it his business to
extract the political intelligence from the leading newspapers&mdash;those
of Holland<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>&mdash;at the same time maintaining a correspondence with
Florence<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> and Brussels. In addition to this, he undertook the
department of canon law, with which his position on the ecclesiastical
committee of the Council of State peculiarly fitted him to deal.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> In
connection with this subject, he read to the society a series of papers
in which he argued strongly for the independence and the pre-eminence
of the civil power. His conclusions might have been less absolute had
he known that they were one day to rise up in judgment against him in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
shape of two formidable quarto volumes.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> In the
general debates he took an active part, and his discussions with St.
Pierre upon the innumerable projects which the latter presented to the
society were recalled by him with lively pleasure.</p>

<p>Though devoted to political research, "the good Entresolists" were
careful to exclude even the suggestion of pedantry. They formed a sort
of "club" on the English model. "We had all sorts of pleasant things,
comfortable seats, a good fire in winter, and in summer windows opened
upon a pretty garden. There was no dinner or supper, but tea was to be
had in winter, and in summer lemonade and cooling drinks. The gazettes
of France, Holland, and even the English papers, were always to be
found there." In a word, it was "un café d'honnêtes gens."<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> On the
summer evenings, when the meeting was over, they used to go for a
stroll round the terrace of the Tuileries, discussing the questions
that had arisen in the debate. In the winter they "went straight home,
and always with a fresh regard for the Entresol."<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>It may well be imagined that a society of this kind must have inspired
a very warm feeling among those who were privileged to take part in
it; and d'Argenson is affectionately anxious to make it clear that
its ultimate dissolution was in no way due to failure of interest. We
might well believe it from the letters of one of its most distinguished
members, the hero of Dantzig, Count de Plélo, whose appointment to
Copenhagen in 1728 was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
largely due to the prestige he acquired as a member
of the Entresol.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> From the cold solitudes of the Baltic he writes to
the President: "O! this accursed climate! Am I never again to breathe
the air of the Entresol?"<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> and again, "A person accustomed to read
the Gazette at the Entresol finds it very dry reading all alone at
Copenhagen."<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> And then, when the crisis came and the society was no
more, he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I can imagine how keenly you feel the unhappy fate which has befallen
the Entresol. Would you ever have believed that anything so innocent
could fall under suspicion? Surely something out of the common must
have happened since my departure, or else the great ones of the earth
have very little to do."<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The attitude of the "great ones" is not without interest. Even Cardinal
Fleury had been compelled to breathe the air of the Regency; and upon
succeeding to the authority of the Duc de Bourbon, he was inclined to
look graciously upon the nascent society.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Nor was his protection
hastily withdrawn, for in the winter of 1730 he appointed its president
Curator of the King's Library, and thither the meetings of the Entresol
were transferred.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> In the following summer it received a further
earnest of ministerial approval in the preferment of Alary to the
tutorship of the Children of France.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> In the elation produced by
these marks of favour the members threw off their accustomed reserve,
and the proceedings of the Entresol acquired a notoriety
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
which was little to the mind of its more cautious spirits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I tired myself to death in recommending moderation and discretion,
even in regard to the name of the Entresol; for I kept saying to them:
'You will see that one fine morning the Government will ask us what we
are about.'"<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But d'Argenson's efforts were powerless to withstand the vain temerity
of some of the members; the fatal day arrived at last; and at one
of the meetings in the autumn of 1731, Alary appeared with the
announcement that he had a poniard in his heart, and that the days
of the Entresol were numbered.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> There was no gainsaying the will
of the Cardinal, and the dissolution was effected in decent silence.
But it was not accepted without an effort. A little conspiracy was
formed among the more earnest members, with d'Argenson for one of the
ringleaders; the day of meeting was changed to Wednesday; the black
sheep were excluded; and it was hoped that by absolute silence and a
careful avoidance of ministers, they would be able to hold on until the
storm had blown over. Yet scarcely three meetings had been held when
d'Argenson fell into the hands of Chauvelin, who extracted from him
a promise that no further effort would be made to revive the beloved
society.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> There was no more to be said.</p>

<p>D'Argenson's personal disappointment was keen enough, nor was he
slow to appreciate the public loss. He writes reproachfully:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It is surprising <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
that so many sciences are cultivated in Europe,
whilst there is not a single school of public law. Why should not
theoretic knowledge be as useful to society in general as to societies
in particular? You aspire to employment in the public service, and
you cannot qualify yourself by preliminary practice; for this is the
fashion which has been introduced into France in our day: people say,
'When I am appointed ambassador, when I am raised to the Ministry, I
will learn the duties of my post.'"<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was not upon d'Argenson that the loss fell; his political
apprenticeship was already complete. On those Saturday evenings in the
Place Vendôme, he had learnt to think clearly and boldly upon public
questions; and the doors of the Entresol were scarcely closed when he
resolved to turn his acquirements to account.</p>

<p>He was now in his thirty-seventh year. His affairs, which had often
given rise to embarrassment, had been arranged by the recent sale of
Réveillon (December, 1730);<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> there appeared to be no further obstacle
in the way of a successful career. He was not slow in adopting the
only means by which a political aspirant could bring himself under the
notice of the governing powers&mdash;the presentation of gratuitous advice;
and it was at this time that he began that series of memoirs which was
continued until after his accession to the ministry, and which would
have been such an invaluable treasury of contemporary history and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
thought.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
Unhappily they all perished in the
burning of the library of the Louvre in 1871,<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> and our only knowledge
of them is derived from fragmentary notices published before that
date. The series appears to have begun in December, 1731; and it is
pleasant to find that here again that amiable influence which had
appeared so early in d'Argenson's career was present to lend him a
guiding hand. A memoir which d'Argenson proposed to present against the
arbitrary distribution of the taille (December, 1731), was scored with
annotations by St. Pierre, who advised that it should be cut down, that
certain vague views about things in general should be excised, and that
the author should confine himself to a single point. "He must not give
occasion to say, 'He is a fine talker, he is an eloquent speaker, <i>qui
bat la campagne</i>.'"<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> St. Pierre was himself too melancholy a proof of
the wisdom of his own advice for d'Argenson to reject it lightly; and
in May, 1732, we find him writing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I was several months without meddling with affairs of state; I did not
wish to give myself out for a maker of memoirs."<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This wholesome caution was not long sustained, nor indeed was it
really necessary. The time was one of keen political excitement. It
was in this very summer of 1732 that the great conflict of old French
privilege and tradition against the arrogant zeal of the Ultramontane
party reached its acutest stage; and it happened that that was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
question of all others with which d'Argenson was competent
to deal. He had been for some years a member of the ecclesiastical
committee of the Council, and at the Entresol, as we have seen, he had
been charged with the department of canon law.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Upon the questions
at issue he entertained ideas at once liberal and politic. He admitted
in principle the plea of ecclesiastical authority; but as a politician
he deprecated any encouragement of its supporters in their factious
proceedings against the Jansenists; the attitude of the Government in
regard to heterodoxy should be simply one of passive disapproval. But
it was no longer time to think of principles and policies; the matter
had now resolved itself into a fierce conflict of privilege between the
Crown and the Parlement of Paris. On the 13th of June the Parlement
accepted an appeal in the teeth of direct orders from the King. The
reception was quashed by a decree of Council, and four magistrates were
sent to join Pucelle in exile. The Chambers of Inquests and Requests
immediately resigned.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179"
class="fnanchor">[179]</a> D'Argenson's views upon the crisis were strong
and clear. They were laid before the Ministry; and the author received
a letter from Chauvelin, the Warden of the Seals, to the effect that
two hours' conversation with him would be of material service to
the Government. He set out at once for Compiègne, halted a moment
for breath, scribbled out a "policy complete," and presented it to
Chauvelin in a secret interview which lasted from five o'clock in the
morning until nine.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the whole of the discussions he appears to have
taken a prominent part; he was kept informed, by secret channels, of
the deliberations of the Cabinet;<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> and he seems to have been treated
throughout as an active and esteemed adviser.</p>

<p>The nature of his advice we are at no loss to determine. Among the
documents destroyed at the Louvre was one written by d'Argenson when
the struggle was at its height. It is in the form of a letter from an
Englishman to a Frenchman.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> In the course of it he says:</p>

<p>"Wherever the sovereignty may reside, it is necessary that authority
should be entire, without partition, and should bow to the judgments
of God alone." He proceeds to urge the necessity of doing away with
the superior courts, or of placing them absolutely at the disposal of
the Crown. In replying to the objection that that would establish "a
veritable Turkish government," he reveals the secret of his peculiar
attitude with regard to royalty in France. "What of it?" he rejoins.
"You live in France under a despotic authority. The die is cast, so
to speak. You must either obey it or destroy it entirely." Its only
restraint must be that imposed by "opinion, reason, delicacy, public
spirit. Is it not the case that for two centuries the progress of
authority in France has been that of peace, art, and morality, and is
it not increasingly active in suppressing violence, whether public or
private?"</p>

<p>How far d'Argenson is to be credited with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
policy adopted is a secret which is buried with
Chauvelin and Fleury. Had he been the moving spirit in the government,

its measures could not have been in stricter conformity with his
advice. By a declaration of the 18th of August, appeals were withdrawn
from the jurisdiction of the Parlement, and the chambers of Inquests
and Bequests were suspended. A "Lit de Justice" followed on the 2nd of
September, and upon the 7th the chambers of Inquests and Requests were
scattered to the four winds.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>This policy, which d'Argenson had perhaps inspired, was not
consistently pursued. It was not for the last time that Chauvelin had
betrayed the Cardinal into bold and decisive action, nor the last time
that Fleury regretted it. His will was absolute, and before three
months had elapsed the declaration and the <i>lettres de cachet</i> were
withdrawn, and the Parlement returned in triumph.</p>

<p>In dealing with d'Argenson's action as Minister, it has been usual to
attribute its strange inconsequence to his own weakness and oscillation
of mind. The indictment is a hazardous one to prefer against the son
of Marc René d'Argenson; and here it is only necessary to say that in
nothing that he ever wrote or did has there appeared to be sufficient
ground for it. There seem to have been few men who have formed their
ideas with a more quick decision, or have clung to them with a more
sane tenacity. His mind cut into the interests which engaged it sharp
and clear as a diamond;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the very fault of it was that it was incapable of
those politic shifts, those timely irresolutions, which have often
been the making of smaller men. Indeed, there is even ground for
suggesting that if, in judging the events of d'Argenson's ministry, his
own real share in them be scrupulously weighed, there may remain no
reason to reject the opinion formed of him, in the beginning of their
relations, by one of the ablest men of his own day, the Warden of the
Seals himself. It is worth remarking that at this very time Chauvelin
was so impressed with his intrepidity of mind that he thought of him
as a possible premier president of the Vacation Chamber, designed to
supersede the Parlement;<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> in other words, as the foremost instrument
of the stringent measures contemplated by the Crown and the most
conspicuous target of a virulent Opposition.</p>

<p>Nor is this the only reply to an imputation which the mere turning of
d'Argenson's pages might almost suffice to dissipate.</p>

<p>Why, it may be asked, was this offer not accepted? D'Argenson himself
shall furnish the answer, surely as pathetic as it is fatally true.
He shrank at Chauvelin's suggestion, protesting that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"at bottom he must be aware of my defects, and that, besides several others, I had
that of being what is called shy and timid; I had been badly brought
up; my father, when I was young, had given all the preference to my
brother;<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
he had only known me during the last two years of his life when I was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the public service."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon a word of deprecation, he repeated</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"it had not been the case in the latter time, and when he once
knew me, the matter changed completely."<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed his new patron could not help regarding him with interest, and
at the same time with embarrassment. He never tired of urging him to
conquer the weakness which dogged his life. He invited him to his
house, "where all France crowded," and asked him to regard it as his
own;<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> he exhorted him to lose no opportunity of making himself at
home with the world and the Court. He said "that before all things
it was necessary to rescue me from the position in which I was, from
a sort of obscurity."<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> His counsels were as assiduous as they were
disinterested;<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> and they were at last heard with impatience by the
man who felt that the power to follow them had passed for ever beyond
his reach.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"But," he represented at last, "provided that I am known to you, and to
the King and the Cardinal, as I see I am known to his Eminence, and as
you have told me I am to his Majesty, what does it matter whether I am
known to the rest?"<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed he felt such dependence to be his one resource. Some years
afterwards he was called to what was, in the circumstances of the
moment, the most important post in the French Government, the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs. He brought to the proof a devotion to the King
which had been the growth of generations; he placed at his service a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
ripe wisdom, a capacity for firm, constructive
statesmanship, such as few of the ministers of the reign possessed.
All he asked was a free hand, and firm and kingly support; for he knew
that he could not have maintained himself for an hour amid the clang of
policies and the machinations of intrigue. He threw himself proudly and
confidently upon the loyalty of the King. He only learnt that the staff
on which he leaned was a bruised reed when it went into his hand and
pierced it.</p>

<p>It was to no mistiness of mind or constitutional indecision that the
vagaries of his ministry were due; but simply to the fact that his
voice was drowned by the clamour of the Council, and his position
sacrificed by the desertion of the King.</p>

<p>D'Argenson could not fail to attract remark, but he was not strong
enough to make himself necessary. Chauvelin had received him with
curiosity and unfeigned regard; but after a time he lost the freshness
of originality, and his shrinking eccentricity alone remained. The
Minister treated him not unkindly. He put him off with promises, and
was lavish of countenance and encouragement; and d'Argenson passed a
couple of years in continual expectation of preferment, and in constant
labour in the directions suggested by his patron. It was at this
time that he began those researches upon foreign politics which were
afterwards to prove so fruitful; and his Journal is henceforth enriched
with discussions of the interests of France abroad, interesting in
themselves, and often admirable for breadth and originality of view.
They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
suggest that though d'Argenson may have been a student and
a recluse, a pedant he certainly was not. One of them, presented
to Chauvelin in 1734 in the form of a memoir, enables us to bring
into just focus the relations between d'Argenson and his political
mentor. It was criticised with his usual directness and vigour by
St. Pierre, who, after pointing out its faults and admonishing the
author, exhorts him not to be discouraged. "At your age," he says,<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
"I was very far from thinking so profoundly upon public affairs," and
he predicts a brilliant future as the reward of his perseverance. It
is in mentioning this same memoir that d'Argenson sums his opinion,
repeatedly expressed, of the man who had been so long his friend. "No
one knows this admirable citizen, and he does not even know himself.
He has given to the public a number of his political works; he has his
eyes fixed upon a goal too far removed from us; and so it happens that
he repeats himself, is always harping upon the same themes, and is
not appreciated. For all that, he is deeply versed in modern history,
present and past; he is an able man; and he has given himself up to
a branch of philosophy, profound and abandoned by all the world,
namely, the true method of political action most conducive to human
happiness."<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>It was no such fate that d'Argenson designed for himself; and with keen
anxiety did he watch for an opening which would enable him to reap the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
fruit of his researches. For a long time he had been secure in the
friendship of the minister; but that resource appeared to be failing
him; nor was he reassured by his keen-witted brother, who warned him
that Chauvelin spent his days in a continual course of duplicity.
D'Argenson's apprehensions were soon confirmed. In July, 1734, upon
rumours of a congress to arrange the preliminaries of peace, he offered
to act as one of the plenipotentiaries.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> His services were declined.
The same fate awaited a request preferred by him shortly afterwards
in favour of a relative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I was mortified, and I see that I was only
agreeable and accredited at the Court, in so far as I was useful; c'est
un commerce!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>he exclaims, flinging down his pen in disgust.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> He took
it up again to write to Chauvelin, informing him that there were some
estates for sale in Touraine, of which the minister might be glad to
have the refusal. He received in reply a letter<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> which, considering
their former friendship, seems cruelly cold. It is barbed with that
icy politeness with which one declines an intimacy no longer desired.
In November the refusal of some vacant places which he had a right to
expect, and which had been directly promised,<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> sufficed to complete
his discomfiture; he could see but the wreck of those ambitions which
had charged his Journal with energy and fire; and throughout the year
1735, the silence of disillusion is scarcely broken.</p>

<p>Not the least of d'Argenson's embarrassments<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
had come from a quarter where a happier man would
have found but help and encouragement. It was in the course of the
year 1733 that the relations between d'Argenson and his wife ended,
by mutual consent, in a judicial separation.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> As the conduct of the
husband has given rise to animadversions which are often more true
than charitable, it may be worth while to dwell upon it for a moment.
D'Argenson had been married in the winter of 1718<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> to Mademoiselle
Méliand, daughter of the Intendant of Lille. The passive form is used
advisedly, for the transaction was arranged between the two families
like the transfer of land;<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> and d'Argenson was only introduced to
his betrothed a few days before the ceremony took place. The lady who
became his wife "would be fifteen next January";<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> and d'Argenson,
as we learn from some amusing letters to Madame de Balleroy, was
not a little embarrassed by his new <i>rôle</i> of "elderly husband."<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
Notwithstanding, he accepted it with dutiful complaisance; and for
some years his attitude towards his young wife was one of affectionate
loyalty, not ungraced by a certain kindly amusement. About the time
of their return from Valenciennes, the relations between them changed
for the worse. Madame d'Argenson was a woman in fact as in name; her
character had developed, and she proved to be a person of average brain
and strong nerve, the very antithesis of her husband. Circumstances
were not wanting to sharpen these radical differences
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
of character, and to provide occasions of offence.
Her husband's affairs were in disorder,<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> and his political success
was long in coming; while the philosophy which was to him excuse and
consolation kindled in his wife but impatient scorn. She took upon
herself the cares of the household, regarding herself, and possibly not
without reason, as its sole support; while her husband chafed against
a solicitude which he looked upon as mere vexatious interference.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> A
conservative in these matters as in so many more, he probably told her
that a wife who was worth anything would know her place, and she may
have replied that she had indeed good reason to know it only too well.
She held ideas upon it which raise one's opinion of her, and which were
very unusual in her day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It is this too," says her husband, "which
has led her to affect an air of absolute independence. She has formed
a narrow-minded conception of all that concerns the proper submission
of a wife, and she is up in arms against everything which detracts from
the position of women in the world. She has far too exalted an idea
of the dignity of the mistress of a house, and thinks very little of
that of the master,"<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The position at last became unbearable;
and Madame d'Argenson resolved to defy that sacred tradition which
guarded legal relationship in old French families, and to look forward
to "a position of scandal as one would long for Paradise." Her will was
inflexible; the separation took place, and one at least of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
parties profited by it to return to a better
mind. D'Argenson, looking back upon his married life, writes of it as
reasonably and contritely as a man can do when he regrets the past
and is sorry for his own share in it. In speaking of the separation,
he says that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"the world has done me the justice to believe that I had
not deserved it, that I did everything I could to avoid it, and that
I acted in the matter with a good feeling and generosity seldom met
with."<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the truth of that statement we have the written testimony
of Madame d'Argenson's own counsel;<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> and it is surely her husband's
only reparation, as it is his best excuse, that for three and twenty
years he loyally fulfilled the burdensome obligations which his own
past misdoing may have contributed to entail.</p>

<p>By the beginning of 1736, d'Argenson appears to have taken fresh
heart; for his Journal is resumed, and with it the interest of the
ministry in him. He is spoken of now as a possible Minister of War,
again as a Premier President of the Parlement of Paris, and then as
the representative of France in Portugal. One report is of curious
interest. It mentioned him as the first minister of Stanislas in
Lorraine. The "république de Platon," for which d'Argenson was destined
by Voltaire, would have been unwontedly near the earth had his friend
become "Secretary of State" to the first of the bourgeois kings.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
Upon this occasion at least, rumour was not without foundation; the
intention to appoint him to Lisbon was tacitly acknowledged;<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
and in November, he was roundly taken to task
by Chauvelin for having been indiscreet enough to mention it to his
brother.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>The appointment had not yet been ratified when an event occurred
which had a lasting influence upon d'Argenson's life. On the 20th
of February, 1737, after a month of ominous rumours, Chauvelin was
disgraced.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The cause of his fall, ostensibly some obscure intrigue
with the King of Sardinia, was really the discovery of an attempt to
secure himself at Court independently of the Cardinal.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Some remarks
which d'Argenson devoted to the incident, reflect in brief the tone
of his Journal, and exhibit the writer in his most characteristic
mood. After speaking of Chauvelin as "the scape-goat" of the ministry,
and attributing his fall to an exaggeration of finesse, he goes on
to observe,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"With regard to that, there is no denying that his ideas
are too great and lofty for the State." ... "I am not very sorry
that he is no longer our Minister; for I only care for a bourgeois
policy, by which one lives on good terms with one's neighbours and is
content to arbitrate between them; and so may have a long time to work
consistently for the prosperity of the interior and the happiness of
every Frenchman."<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>His satisfaction was not wholly unalloyed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I cannot help regretting the loss of such a fine opportunity of expelling
for ever from Italy the Emperors of Germany. There can be no doubt that
it was possible; and we should have had all Europe behind us if, acting
with frank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
good faith, we had strengthened the lesser powers
with the spoils of the House of Austria in Italy, without attempting
in any way to secure them for the House of Bourbon. We had only to
make this resolution understood at Madrid by some one who knew his own
mind, and who would say to them once for all, 'Will you have all or
nothing?' in order to give to Spain the Two Sicilies, which has been
done by arrangement; or, if the worst came to the worst, to form a
general league to act against Spain and the Emperor combined. For what
better view could there be than that of giving prosperity to Italy,
and banishing war for ever from the peninsula."<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>D'Argenson's regret is almost passionate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I will say more. His Eminence will be ever
answerable before God for having lost this opportunity, only obtained
at the cost of so much blood. The effort, fruitless though it has been,
has perhaps quenched our star."<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Together with the seals, Chauvelin had held the portfolio of Foreign
Affairs; and with regard to it d'Argenson writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The Foreign Ministry is still a-begging. I did not ask for it, but it
has been done on my behalf. At first my principal care was to avoid the
self-reproach of doing anything which should savour of satisfaction
at my friend's disgrace. For this I have not only the testimony of my
conscience, but also of M. Chauvelin. The poor man writes to tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
me he has one consolation in that I am now known
for what I am worth.</p>

<p>"I am worth little, but I burn with love for the happiness of my
fellow-citizens; and if that were known, I should certainly be desired
in office."<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>About the same time he speaks of Count d'Argenson, who, with very
little regard for the happiness of his fellow-citizens, was very much
more successful. "Le cadet" had just been appointed Director of the
Press,<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> and d'Argenson writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Here is my brother, who has thrown himself for all he is worth into
the party of the Molinists. What a pity it is that a brother of mine
should think only of himself, should desire nothing but for himself,
should be in everything the centre of his circle! Such a passion
excludes public spirit. It leaves no room for that love of the common
good, which one should long for after one's simple happiness, and far
before one's own aggrandisement; for what folly is grandeur, and the
thirst for power!... For the remarkable thing is that my brother cares
more for a place which comes to him through an underground channel,
through a party and through an intrigue, than by the way, simple and
noble though it be, of capacity recognised and employed."<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which was all very true, and at all of which that amiable sceptic would have
laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>If the strait and narrow way was a little arduous, it was none the less
resolutely pursued; and in April, 1737, d'Argenson was able to write:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"To-day has been a great day for me. The King has appointed
me his ambassador in Portugal."<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> The charge, in the circumstances
of the moment, might well have been an important one; and it was
gratefully undertaken as a step to higher things.</p>

<p>"My whole design, in accepting the post which the King has just
conferred upon me, has been to fit myself and to render myself eligible
for office in the Ministry."<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the elation of the moment, he reviews his chances of succeeding
to the Chancellorship, which promised to become vacant by the withdrawal
of D'Aguesseau.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Now, at the King's age and in the circumstances of the reign, the man who becomes
Chancellor with the cognisance of affairs of state, might well become
first minister, by reason of the priority of rank which his office
bestows. Et voilà comme on se laisse aller à des pensées ambitieuses!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the philosopher concludes,<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> with that characteristic laugh at his own
weaknesses.</p>

<p>D'Argenson's intimacy with the fallen minister had awakened some
misgivings in the mind of the Cardinal; and the new ambassador takes
occasion to remark:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"With regard to all that, my course is very easy;
simplicity and straightforwardness will always be my warrant against
the suspicion of such connections, with which my name has never been
mixed up."<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is curious that the man who wrote these words should have been on
the threshold of a period when his prime interest and most active
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
concern was centred in a labyrinth of Court
intrigue. For about six years he was absorbed and immersed in the
designs directed by a party at Court against the influence of Cardinal
Fleury. Of all the pages of his Journal, the volume and a half in
which this period is embraced is the least admirable and the least
attractive; for the man is keenly interested in the issue of the
struggle; not an incident or a detour escapes him; and we have an
almost daily record of hopes and plans and futile ambitions, sometimes
outbreaks of revolting spleen, set down in pages which are as difficult
to read in cold blood as they were easy to write in heat. There is no
question that the tone of hard hostility which criticism of d'Argenson
has so often assumed, is explained, if it is not warranted, by the
revelations of this period. Even the appreciation of St. Beuve was
almost quenched by their perusal when the volumes of Rathery came into
his hands; and in the last of his "Causeries" devoted to d'Argenson,
the luminous enthusiasm of his earlier essays is exchanged for a tone
of coldness and disillusion.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Had the prince of critics held the
strife of politics in less abhorrence, he might have seen less reason
to abandon the attitude which invested his earlier essays, not only
with justice, but with charm.</p>

<p>Appreciation of d'Argenson may be sufficiently great to justify an
attempt to present these years in a light more attractive and perhaps
more true than that in which they have frequently appeared.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
The inquiry is no unimportant one. D'Argenson
has been charged, not with mere personal ambition, but with rancour
awakened by personal pique. The issue will decide whether he was
indeed the man that he himself imagined, or whether, with all his fine
philosophy, he was really no larger than any of the men against whose
littleness he inveighed.</p>

<p>No sooner was Chauvelin dismissed (February, 1737) than d'Argenson
takes occasion to review the consequences. The Ministry is reduced
to a satrapy of six, all absolutely equal, and none distinguished
by remarkable ability. In a few words he sums the situation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If a monarch prefers work to amusement, the system is good; but if he does
not, one may judge of the consequences."<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this time he was on the
best of terms with Fleury; and in April, after receiving an immediate
promise of the Portuguese embassy, he quits him with the significant
remark:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We should be happy if his knowledge of men were as great as
his knowledge of affairs."<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In April, his appointment was ratified;
he had already acquired an extended knowledge of Portuguese affairs;
and he was not without hope of counteracting the commanding influence
in Portugal secured to England by the Methuen Treaty.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Before long,
however, difficulties arose about his emoluments; and on mentioning the
matter to Maurepas in July, he was not reassured by "the lively and
malicious pleasure" with which his complaints were received.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> We know
that d'Argenson was in no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
position to maintain an Embassy at his own
expense,<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> as Amelot, a year afterwards, had the indecency to suggest;
and we know also, from the character of Fleury, that he was little
inclined to deal handsomely by the men who had nothing but their
ability to devote to his service. It has been far too readily assumed
that the rupture of the project was due to d'Argenson's intriguing
ambition, and that his protestations in regard to the Cardinal were
only a blind. As we learn from a comparison of the dates, they were
nothing of the sort; and true as it may be that sometime afterwards,
his eagerness to set out was qualified by hopes in another direction,
it is certain that in the summer of 1737, when he was solely dependent
on the Cardinal and not yet in alliance with the opposition at Court,
the only circumstance that retarded his departure was his difficulty
in obtaining a sufficient emolument to support the dignity of an
ambassador.</p>

<p>At this time and for long afterwards, there was no quarrel between
d'Argenson and Fleury; they were, outwardly at least, upon the best of
terms. But in August, 1737, a new feature begins to display itself.
D'Argenson records the existence of a party at Court, whose principal
instrument was the king's valet Bachelier, and whose principal object
was to rouse the King to an active interest in affairs, and to
strengthen the ministry by the inclusion of Belleisle, and possibly by
the appointment of d'Argenson as Controller-General.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> With
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
his usual confidence and zeal, d'Argenson threw
himself into line with this party. In January, 1738, he writes for
the first time:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It is believed that Cardinal Fleury is nearing his
end, and that he is falling into a state of lethargy; he abstains
from work almost entirely;"<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and in March, in the first of his
oft-repeated speculations upon the character of the King, he writes:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In all this, there is promise of a happy reign; God send it may be! It
will be this soul that we must endeavour to please, and not worthless
subjects who have become kings, and who have passions of envy, pride,
and mischievousness;"<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>a reference to the unhappy administration.
In April, a new light breaks upon him, and he conjectures, very truly
it appeared, that the moving spirit of the Court opposition was M.
Chauvelin himself; his triumph is necessitated by "the horrible
weakness of our present ministers."<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> All this time, d'Argenson was
assured of a prominent place in the ministerial reconstruction which
appeared to be imminent; and he is never tired of enlarging upon
the incompetence of the men who were left to bear the weight of the
Cardinal's government.</p>

<p>With the Cardinal himself, it is important to remember, he had at this
time but one quarrel; and so late as November, 1738, he continues to
write as follows:<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Never has any of our kings or ministers had so
little knowledge of men as Cardinal Fleury. It has been the greatest
misfortune which the nation has suffered under his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
ministry; for had it not been for this capital
defect in any man who governs, we should have gone very far under an
administrator so virtuous and so disinterested."<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far from an open rupture having taken place, he received from the
Cardinal in January, 1739, a promise of the embassy at Naples;<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> and two months afterwards
he was nominated by him to report upon a quarrel which had arisen in
connection with the University.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> At this time his alliance with the
forward party at Court had lasted nearly two years; and the ground of
his adhesion was not personal disappointment or private pique, but
a feeling of the public necessity of strengthening the ministry by
pressure brought to bear upon the Cardinal.</p>

<p>Six months afterwards his attitude had changed. The manifest
determination of Fleury to repress every influence but his own,
combined with a sudden crisis in public affairs to destroy the tone of
tolerance or esteem with which d'Argenson had continued to regard him.
In July, 1739, he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The rumours are growing that the tyranny
of the Cardinal is nearing its close. I say tyranny; for when all is
said, nothing is more hateful than the government of an old tutor,
without birth and without ability, eighty-six years of age, choked with
self-love and with a mania for ruling, leaning on subordinates worse
than himself, whom he maintains without question, and ousting his king
from the government at his own will and pleasure."<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a letter to Chauvelin (April 24th)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
he had expressed the tone which is henceforth
assumed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Our affairs abroad continue to move only by the impetus which
you have given them. As to the rest, it is left to chance, and to a
star which may pale. The unity of policy is lost; general plans are
treated as chimerical systems, or as 'great questions,' which certainly
do create genuine terror among the smallest heads which our nation has
ever seen at its own."<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So runs the tale for many years. General declamation against the
incompetence of the ministers is exchanged for a scathing relentless
impeachment of every branch of the administration. The Journal of 1739
contains some of the most terrible pictures ever drawn of the internal
condition of France; and the government of the interior is arraigned
with all the triumphant detail of an unanswerable indictment. When
the extreme of misery had passed, there remained the vicissitudes of
foreign policy to sharpen the bitterness of d'Argenson's pen. The war
of the Indies, the crisis in the Empire, gave occasion for many a
philippic against the senile absurdity of the Cardinal's statecraft.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
Nor was this all; for his hand is continually upon the Cardinal's
pulse; his eyes are perpetually bent upon the King; his own prospects
are weighed in an ever-changing balance; and d'Argenson, King and
Cardinal are canvassed until the reader is sick and weary of them all.
Occasionally the narrative is divested alike of dignity and of reason;
and we sometimes meet with a rude savagery of feeling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
and expression which suggest that beneath
d'Argenson's usual beauty of heart there lurked unsightly possibilities.</p>

<p>Such are the facts, unpleasing enough; it remains to determine their
critical value.</p>

<p>A first impression that the brain of the writer is haunted by some
grotesque chimera, and that his political prospects are the pure
creation of his own vanity and ambition, proves upon investigation
to be false. There existed at Court during this period an active and
formidable party, bent upon overthrowing the Cardinal; and for six
years there was not a single month when Fleury's position might not
have been imperilled by a moment of manliness on the part of the King.
That moment&mdash;it was an amiable fondness&mdash;was constantly expected;<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
and had it followed upon any of the passages of d'Argenson's Journal,
what appears as mere fatuous aspiration might be read as the words
of truth and soberness. It is, moreover, reasonable to suggest that
had the writer been more intimately conversant with the world and its
ways, he would never have written one-tenth of what he felt; and that,
had he not been the author of some of the loftiest and profoundest
truths which political morality has ever uttered, his violences
and excitements would have remained in the obscurity in which such
accidents should be privileged to rest.</p>

<p>But there is another question involved, the question whether his
criticism is the mere outcome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of factious opposition, or is the wise and just
conviction of a patriot and an honest man. A brief examination will
suffice.</p>

<p>He pronounced against the men in power, and history has endorsed his
verdict. Among the six ministers who carried the train of Cardinal
Fleury, there was not one whose name has not to be sought for in his
despatches, or who was qualified to be his own head clerk. The only man
who, by the duration and the vicissitudes of his career, has secured
a precarious place in history, is M. de Maurepas. So much for the
men; we have yet to see whether d'Argenson's estimate of the general
administration could equally boast the warrant of fact.</p>

<p>There are two sides to the questions suggested by the government of
Fleury. There is no denying that his negative policy conferred great
benefits on France; there is equally little question that it sowed the
seed of many a disaster. If he did nothing to dissipate the resources
of the country, he did equally little to increase them. He neglected
commerce, and through the accident of the time it flourished. He
neglected finance and the interior, and the ruin of the provinces
proceeded unchecked. During these six years he did nothing for the
policy of France abroad, and it drifted into the state in which we
are soon to see it. In a word, he raised political nihilism to the
dignity of a faith, and the deluge of circumstance had to be faced by
his successors. His policy brought its peculiar consequences. The most
striking was the decadence of the French marine. But it produced an
effect which was far less obvious,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
and far more insidiously fatal.
With M. Chauvelin, he had banished from his ministry its only element
of constructive strength. D'Argenson had been glad that the man whose
"ideas were too great and lofty," was in power no longer, and only too
ready to take shelter beneath the bourgeois policy of Fleury.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> He
was not long in discovering his error. The world is not a bourgeois
creation, nor can it be governed upon bourgeois principles; and if
genius in power is often destructive, it is none the less often
necessary. It was by the consistent ostracism of genius that Fleury,
in a profoundly critical period, maintained himself in power; and when
his will at last succumbed to circumstance, he left his country to
drift before the winds bereft of policy or guiding hand. We have soon
to examine one department of the government, and that in connection
with d'Argenson himself. There may be reason to suggest that if his
criticism of Fleury has been violent and harsh, the conduct of French
foreign policy during the years 1745 and 1746 is one long commentary
upon its substantial justice. D'Argenson was a man of strange political
sympathy and insight. Barbier and the element he represented, might
look on with applause, and commend the Cardinal's moderation and
prudence. To a patriot who had the sagacity to foresee what his
so-called moderation might mean, the spectacle must have been full of
provocation; and it is sufficient to conclude that if d'Argenson's
narrative is deformed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
by the violence of exasperation, its motives were
as pure as the feeling was keen.</p>

<p>It is with the pleasure of relief that we turn to another interest of
d'Argenson's life, as sweet and engaging as the former is sometimes
repellent. It presents him, not as the violent, eager partisan, but in
the light of a loyal and warm-hearted friendship. It is in the spring
of 1739 that we mark the beginning of his intimacy with Voltaire.</p>

<p>D'Argenson and he had been at school together; but since they had
parted in the Rue St. Jacques<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> their ways in life had lain far
apart. Arouet had been absorbed by that brilliant coterie whose host
was Vendôme and whose laureate was Chaulieu;<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> while d'Argenson
pursued the path of the robe, which led far away from the dazzling
dissoluteness of the Temple. Nor were they thrown together more closely
in maturer life; for while d'Argenson, with some chosen spirits, was
developing the purely French tradition of political thought, his
friend, a guest at Twickenham and Battersea, was accustoming his eyes
to that foreign light which he was afterwards to diffuse so fatefully
around him. About the time at which d'Argenson joined the Entresol,
Voltaire set out for England.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Separated as they were, they retained
that easy good-feeling which only school companionship can inspire.
Upon Voltaire's return they met more frequently, and in their letters
their old discussions upon art and politics at the house of a popular
society lady,<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> are often the theme of pleasant recollection.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>
<p>It was not, however, until the opening of the correspondence whose
occasion and character we have now to record, that their casual
acquaintance ripened into intimacy. Many of Voltaire's letters have
never been recovered; and d'Argenson's, with scarcely an exception,
have perished entirely. Still, there remain enough to form an
intelligible series, and to throw a very attractive light upon the
character of the men concerned.</p>

<p>It was in the beginning of 1739 that Voltaire, incensed by a more
than usually scurrilous libel, appealed to his friend for protection
in an attempt to force the author<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> to a disavowal of his work. With
the ready loyalty characteristic of him, d'Argenson accepted the
trust;<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> and until the close of the quarrel he became the poet's
"chargé d'affaires accredited to the literary police." Such of his
letters as are preserved are truly charming, and they read strangely
beside many a page of his Journal written at the same date. They are
graced throughout by that open-hearted confidence which d'Argenson
was always so ready to accord; and nothing can be sweeter than the
self-congratulation with which he tells Voltaire of his success.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> He
was in constant communication with Madame du Châtelet; and d'Argenson
joined Madame in a conspiracy of kindness to restrain the vivacities of
their outraged friend.</p>

<p>Voltaire was not the man to undervalue such services. His letters are
full of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
expressions of gratitude, as delicate as they are sincere; he cast
about for a means of displaying it more amply; and with many another
earnest of confidence and regard, d'Argenson received the opening
chapters of the "Histoire du Siècle de Louis XIV.," and with it the
assurance, "I wish to please you so much; and you will see that if I do
not succeed, it is not for want of working upon subjects which are dear
to you."<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> D'Argenson must have been emboldened by the confidence of
his friend, for soon after, Voltaire received a letter, and with it an
extract of a certain manuscript from d'Argenson's own pen.</p>

<p>The keen surprise and pleasure which attended its perusal are written
in every line of Voltaire's reply:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"My dear Sir, Providence has kept me here a day longer than we intended
in order that I might receive the most pleasing letter that I have had
since Madame du Châtelet has ceased to write. I have just been reading
to her the extract you have been good enough to make for us from a work
of which it may be said, more justly than of 'Télémaque,' that if any
book could confer happiness upon mankind, it would be this.... We have
not here the mere dreams of a good-hearted man, like the good Abbé
de St. Pierre and M. de Fénélon; there is here something more real,
and something which experience proves in the most striking manner....
Madame du Châtelet is enchanted with your plan. By this post I have
received a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
letter from a prince, whose first minister you
would be, if you had been born in his country."<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Upon earnest representations that they are "the most honest people
in the world," and that they would return the book "without copying
a word," the entire manuscript was forwarded to Brussels. It is
acknowledged in a letter of the 21st of June:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"My dear Sir, I have just finished reading a work which consoles me for
the flood of bad books
wherewith we are inundated.... How have you had the courage, you, whose
house is as old as M. de Boulainvilliers', to declare so generously
against him and his fiefs? That is the thing I cannot get over; you
have divested yourself in favour of the public of the dearest prejudice
to which men can cling.... Good-bye. Go and make the French loved in
Portugal, and leave me the hope that I shall see again a man who does
so much honour to France. An Englishman had put upon his tomb: 'Here
lies the friend of Philip Sidney;' allow me to write my own epitaph:
'Here lies the friend of the Marquis d'Argenson.'"<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>"There is a place that one does not procure for cash down, and that I
merit by the most respectful attachment and the most high esteem."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last word is significant; Voltaire was attached to his friends; his
esteem was reserved for his equals.</p>


<p>The book was kept for six weeks, when Voltaire returned by Moussinot</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"the best and most instructive work that I have read for twenty
years.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>... I am assured that the author of this unique work is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
not going to Lisbon<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>to bury his talents for
guiding men and making them happy. May he remain at Paris, and may
I find him again in one of those posts where, up to the present, so
much harm has been done and so little good. If I had myself to choose,
I swear that I would not set foot again in Paris until I saw M.
d'Argenson in the place of his father, and at the head of letters....
Madame du Châtelet is as charmed as I, and will praise you to much
better purpose."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never did Voltaire speak with more enthusiasm, and never was the
feeling more generous and sincere. He had suddenly discovered among a
crowd of other noble protectors a man of rare and unexpected power; and
for some time the letters to d'Argenson are sufficient to show that
he had sensibly risen in Voltaire's esteem. The praises he received
were accompanied by a full and careful criticism, the hasty reading of
which may have given rise to a gratuitous impeachment of the writer's
sincerity. The suggestion will be presently considered;<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> here it is
enough to say that it was no ordinary political work which, in 1739,
could arouse the enthusiasm of Voltaire.</p>

<p>A third episode in the correspondence is of some importance. It was
through Voltaire that d'Argenson acquired his first knowledge of a man
to whom he was afterwards introduced more intimately by events, the
young Prince Royal of Prussia. Among other marks of regard, Voltaire
sent him some of the prince's letters, and asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
him to share his admiration. It may be imagined
that d'Argenson, in whom devotion to royalty was hereditary, and
whose regard for merit was always so keen, was not slow to echo the
enthusiasm of his friend.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> From this time forward he watched with
lively and appreciative interest the development of Frederick's career,
and upon the frequent letters which found their way into his hands he
formed a conception of the Prince's character which was not without its
influence upon future events. Its essence is contained in some words he
wrote on hearing of Frederick's accession (June, 1740):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Il fera ce qu'il faudra faire."<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>His pleasure at the event is only qualified by the pitiful contrast
presented by the King upon whom his hopes had so long been built.</p>

<p>Such are the principal features of this delightful correspondence. It
was continued with more or less intermission until the end of 1744,
when d'Argenson found occasion to exercise his friend's pen in matters
of more than epistolary weight. Throughout the difficulties of an
arduous ministry, his task was lightened and his efforts cheered by the
encouragement and co-operation of Voltaire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the end of 1740, d'Argenson had succeeded his brother as chancellor
of the Orleans household;<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> in November 1744, he was invited to accept
a place in the Government as Minister of Foreign Affairs.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> His
brother, Count d'Argenson, was already Minister of War, and since the
dismissal of Amelot in April, had been signing the despatches of the
Foreign Office.</p>

<p>The appointment of a man without any diplomatic experience or high
official knowledge to what was, in the circumstances of the moment,
the most important position in the Ministry, might well, at any other
period, have given occasion for remark. At this time, however, the
Government was peculiarly constituted; its policy was dictated by
Marshal de Noailles, who had no official position; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
all that was required of the new Minister was not
plans or policies of action, but the dutiful deference and docility of
his predecessor. The eyes of Noailles would have opened widely could he
have read some of the pages which the new Secretary had already devoted
to the principles and conduct of French foreign policy.</p>

<p>D'Argenson's ministry lasted rather more than two years, and came
to a close in January 1747. The period was an eventful one; and our
knowledge of it is derived from diplomatic correspondence in every
capital in Europe. The evidence has been digested in several important
works, notably the elaborate study in four volumes by the Duc de
Broglie,<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> and the comprehensive monograph by M. Edgar Zevort.</p>

<p>These works are valuable and authoritative, but their conclusiveness
may be disputed. There are many suggestions with which any one who has
made a close personal study of d'Argenson may find it difficult to
agree; while the divergencies of detail, and sometimes of conclusion,
between the two writers, the admirably chosen series of documents given
by M. Zevort, and, above all, a careful acquaintance with d'Argenson's
own Journal for ten years before, suggest the necessity and afford
ample scope for some independent criticism. It would seem, indeed,
that these works have been undertaken primarily with a view to the
general history of France; and that no adequate effort has been made to
determine d'Argenson's real share in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the events for which he bears the official
responsibility. There is only too good reason to know that in many
critical conjunctures, the foreign policy of France was only pursued
because the Foreign Minister was powerless to avert it. Indeed there
is reasonable ground for suspecting that no pains have been spared in
comprehending everything but the Marquis d'Argenson himself; and that,
if the perusal of his official despatches had been illumined by the
study of his unofficial memoirs, the character of his action might have
been explained more naturally than by the suggestion of stupidity or
confusion of mind.</p>

<p>It is true that M. Zevort endeavours to illustrate d'Argenson's
political principles from his own "Essai de l'exercice du tribunal
européen par la France seule;" but it may very well be doubted whether
this piece possesses the importance which has been attached to it. It
was written shortly after, or possibly before, the fall of Chauvelin,
and at least seven years before d'Argenson's accession to the Ministry.
In November 1737, when it appeared in manuscript, France was at
peace, Fleury was still Minister, the war between Spain and England
had not broken out, the old House of Austria was not yet extinct, and
Frederick was still Prince Royal of Prussia. In the interval the face
of Europe had wholly changed. Moreover the "Essai" consists of no more
than half-a-dozen widely printed pages, placed at the end of the 1764
edition of the "Considérations,"<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> and omitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
altogether from that of 1784. It contains a few
loose remarks about Russia and the northern powers, with some views
upon Spain and Austria which are the commonplaces of d'Argenson's
Journal. Almost the only remarkable feature are some significant
words upon the position of England, which show that the shadow of
1763 was already falling across the path of France.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Indeed the
piece appears to be really nothing more than a brief academic essay,
written, as we learn from the title-page of the manuscripts in the
Library of the Arsenal, as a note upon St. Pierre's "Projet de la Paix
Perpétuelle."<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> That the author regarded it as of small importance is
clear from his failure to exhibit in his Journal any further affection
for its leading idea, the exercise of international arbitration by
France alone; his subsequent criticism of Fleury is little more than a
consistent denial of it; and we can point to at least one passage where
its central principle is categorically rejected.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> It is true that the
conception of a benevolent arbitration exercised by France remained as
a shadowy and distant ideal before d'Argenson's mind; but that it had
ever any serious influence upon his practical ideas of policy there is
no evidence to suggest. Even if it be admitted, with M. Zevort, that
these were "the ideas, some ingenious, others chimerical, almost all
beyond realisation, which d'Argenson nourished in 1737," it may be
denied, with some distinctness, that "he brought them to the ministry
in 1744."<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not here, but in the pages of his Journal for ten years before,
that we must search for the secret of d'Argenson's thought. It is
true that the running commentary upon foreign politics which is here
continued from time to time<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> is, upon a first or a casual reading, as
bewildering as many have found it; but it will appear upon study and
reflection, that the writer's views, many-sided as they are, revolve
about half-a-dozen leading principles, which perpetually recur, are
immediately recognised, and from which the author never materially
swerves. These principles are based upon profound thought and mature
research; and the divergence of view which is superficially apparent
is due to their constant adaptation to the circumstances of the moment
as affected by fortune or failure, success or reverse. There is no man
to whom inconsequence of mind has been more speciously imputed than to
d'Argenson, and surely none who has deserved it less.</p>

<p>The ideas which d'Argenson did bring to the Ministry must be set forth
as briefly as clearness will allow.</p>

<p>He held that in the dealings of a great nation, the profoundest
principle of policy was simple straightforwardness, and that France was
in a condition which enabled her to apply that principle with effect.</p>

<p>Her legitimate expansion was already complete; she had nothing further
to gain by aggression; and her statesmen should be henceforth as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
careful for the extension of her prosperity as they
had hitherto been for the extension of her borders.</p>

<p>It was necessary to allay the inveterate distrust awakened in Europe by
the designs of Louis XIV., and by the junction of the Bourbon houses.
The alliance with Spain was of doubtful advantage; and it was the
interest of France, while remaining on the most friendly terms with
that power, to discountenance, and if necessary to repress, the Spanish
ambitions in Italy. At the same time, every support should be given to
Spain in her resistance to the commercial aggrandisement of England.</p>

<p>While abstaining from aggression, France, in accordance with her
traditional policy, should lose no opportunity of destroying the power
of the House of Austria in Germany; the death of the Emperor Charles
VI. should be made the occasion for a partition of the Austrian
dominions;<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> and the influence, and if need be, the arms of France,
should be used in favour of the various pretenders.</p>

<p>Every effort should be made to strengthen the position of the smaller
powers, le tiers parti, as a counterpoise to the influence of Hapsburgs
and Bourbons alike; the movements of Sardinia, Bavaria, Saxony, Poland
and Prussia in the direction of independence, should receive the
encouragement of France.</p>

<p>The designs of Russia should be held in check
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
by an defensive alliance with Sweden and Denmark.</p>

<p>As regards England, France should make no attempt to force the
Pretender upon an unwilling people; but she should resolutely resist
the efforts of England to establish a commercial monopoly, and declare
war rather than allow the seizure of the Spanish colonies in America.
The means were to be found in the withdrawal of Holland from English
influence, support of the colonial policy of Spain, and above all, the
restoration of the French marine in view of a great maritime war.</p>

<p>Not the least admirable object which a statesman could embrace would
be the expulsion of the Austrians from Italy, and the surrender of
the whole peninsula to an Italian confederation. The project in
truth was an ideal one; but it was commended by its apparent ease of
execution&mdash;already proved by M. Chauvelin<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>&mdash;and by the severity of
the blow it would inflict upon Austria.</p>

<p>Behind all was the fact that the French provinces were in a critical
condition; and every livre spent in war, and every man lost in battle,
were spent and lost at the expense of the provinces. The paramount need
of France was ten years of peace, retrenchment, and reform.</p>

<p>Such are the main principles of d'Argenson's political theory. In his
Journal for ten years past it is possible to watch them, not in a very
meagre reduction to their lowest terms, but as in process of growth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
and of adaptation to an ever-changing
variety of mood and circumstance. This variety of view, at first the
source of continual embarrassment, becomes at last our surest guide;
for it reveals the most intimate turn of d'Argenson's thought; and
it enables us to divine the aspect from which a particular question
is likely to be regarded, his probable choice between alternative
courses, and the principles upon which the difficulties of the moment
are likely to be resolved. One further reflection the Journal suggests.
The tenacity with which these leading principles are maintained is only
equalled by their rapidity of adaptation and clearness of grasp; nor
can we avoid the suspicion that if the action of the French Foreign
Minister should appear to be characterised by a strange inconsequence,
the cause is to be sought elsewhere than simply in his own bewilderment
and confusion.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to consider that question, a word remains to be said
about a few of the men with whom d'Argenson was soon to be engaged.
He was already well known in the diplomatic circle at Paris, and with
two, at least, of its leading members he was upon intimate terms. One
of them was the Marquis de Valori, the French envoy at Berlin, whom
d'Argenson had introduced to Voltaire as early as 1739;<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> the other
was the ambassador of Holland, M. van Hoey. Van Hoey was a man after
d'Argenson's own heart. He sought, in sympathy with his friend, to
raise the tone of politics, its huckstering pettiness of means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
and motives, by a certain philosophy of his own,
a philosophy which is not more visionary than most things good, nor
more ridiculous than most things noble, but with which the man of the
world will refuse to meddle, and at which "le peuple petit-maître," in
d'Argenson's words,<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> will go on laughing to the end of time. Before
the minister had attained his present position, Van Hoey had esteemed
his person and valued his advice; and in the previous year (1743) he
had even transmitted to the Hague a long account of a conversation with
"un seigneur," whom no one who has read a hundred pages of d'Argenson's
writing will have any difficulty in identifying.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>There was another personage in the forefront of politics, whose career
d'Argenson had not watched in vain. The Prince Royal of Prussia had
gone far since the spring of 1739, when the friend of Voltaire was
privileged to receive his letters. Time had made little impression upon
d'Argenson's first estimate of him. He admired his devotion and his
strength of character; and he had even some kindness for that 'splendid
mendacity' to which Anti-Machiavel had been converted by events. It was
to no childish sentiment of hero-worship that his regard was due; but
to a firm and surely reasonable conviction that Frederick was strong
enough to afford to be honest, that such a man did not make engagements
which he would be glad to repudiate, or break his word when he could
possibly help it. He felt that now, as at Frederick's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
accession,<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
his interests were coincident with
those of France; and that the King of Prussia had only to be treated
with honesty and supported well, to prove the soundest ally in Europe.</p>

<p>On the 15th of November, 1744, a proclamation was issued<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> directing a
general thanksgiving for the capture of Fribourg, the recovery of the
King, and the successes of the late campaign. Three days afterwards
d'Argenson became Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>The fall of Fribourg closed the events of the year in Alsace. Thither
in August the King had hurried from Flanders upon hearing that as
Frederick had predicted, the Austrians, under Prince Charles of
Lorraine, had crossed the Rhine and were ravaging French territory.
Louis had no sooner arrived than he was stricken down with fever at
Metz; while, through the culpable negligence of his generals Noailles
and Coigny, the Prince of Lorraine had been allowed to escape and
to join the resistance to Frederick, who had again drawn the sword
against Maria Theresa, and had fulfilled his promise of the Treaty
of Frankfort (1st June, 1744) by a dashing descent upon Bohemia. His
communications were threatened by the return of Prince Charles; Prague
was evacuated by the Prussians, and Frederick withdrew with all his
forces into Silesia. He was weary of the war, which had long been
utterly objectless; he saw clearly enough that its further prolongation
could only postpone what it could not prevent, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
eventual triumph of Maria Theresa; he would have
been glad to escape upon any terms which would leave him in possession
of his hard won conquest. On the 26th of November he wrote to Louis
XV., suggesting that negotiations for peace should be set on foot,
demanding nothing for himself, and proposing as a basis the cession of
Upper Austria, and the recognition of the Emperor by Maria Theresa.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>To this overture d'Argenson drafted a reply (December 17th). France,
rivalling Frederick in disinterestedness, would be content to provide
equitably for her allies, would renounce her own conquests in Flanders,
and accept the mediation of Saxony. Over this draft was written, "N'
a point servi." D'Argenson, taken aback, and feeling it necessary to
make sure of his ground, requested the King to inform him definitely of
his attitude on the question of peace. In reply he received (December
23rd), a memorandum,<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> in which the King expressed his desire for
peace, deprecated any positive negotiation, and declared that the most
direct way of realising his desire would be by "the most vigorous war."
On the same day Louis wrote to Frederick,<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> discussing the proposals
of the latter, and marking not the least eagerness to second his
pacific designs.</p>

<p>D'Argenson was by no means blind to the meaning of the King's
memorandum. "If the King was animated by the desire for peace, he was
still more so by the love of glory;"<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> he had just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
made his first campaign under the auspices of
Madame de Châteauroux; and he looked forward to recovering in Flanders
the easy laurels which had been snatched from him in the previous
year.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
D'Argenson feared for the result. His view of the interest of
France was wise and clear. The attempt to humble the House of Austria
had failed;<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> "peace, no matter how it came, was now the principal
object;"<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> the best means of securing it was "to stand upon the
defensive in every quarter with foresight and success."<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> In this way
the Queen of Hungary would be convinced of the hopelessness of her
plans of vengeance, and the opinion of the peace party in the several
courts would have time to make itself felt.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly, "<i>a few days after</i>" receiving the King's memorandum,
d'Argenson presented to him a memoir, his reference to which is of the
first importance. He proposed that France should confine herself to "<i>a
simple defensive in Flanders, not only for fear of raising a dangerous
storm in that quarter, but in order to throw more weight upon the two
other theatres of war, Germany and Italy. It was in these directions
that the chief objects lay; and so far from being able to carry all
before us, we were not even sure of holding our ground. It was in
Germany that the Queen of Hungary was concentrating her principal
forces, while she left to the maritime powers the task of defending the
Low Countries. In Italy we required to be superior to the Spaniards, in
order to direct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
them well</i>."<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> So far as d'Argenson personally is
concerned, the above appears to be the most valuable record to be found
in his ministerial memoirs.</p>

<p>On the 26th of December and the 4th and 8th of January, three letters
were written by Frederick,<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> which show that events are moving
rapidly. He declares that if negotiations are to be undertaken, it must
be done at once;<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> that he has himself to deal with twenty thousand
Hungarians in Upper Silesia;<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> that a strong detachment of Prince
Charles's army is on the confines of Bavaria;<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> and that events of
gravity are only to be averted by the reinforcement of the army of
the Lower Rhine, and the despatch of immediate and effective succour
to the Emperor and the Bavarian army. "At the present moment, these
two positions appear to me of capital importance. They are no slight
reverses of which we are running the risk, but the frustration of all
our present measures, and even of those for the coming campaign."
(January 8, 1745).<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>The reception which awaited these representations is significant. In
the first days of January, an Austrian force, after repulsing a weak
French detachment, established itself upon Bavarian territory.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> At
that very moment the Emperor, in reply to his prayers and entreaties,
received a letter<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>(January 2nd), in which the French King, with
manifest impatience, declared himself unable to satisfy his demands.
Upon the 9th Louis, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
a reply to Frederick, asserted that there was
no reason to believe that an Austrian advance was imminent,<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
and declined to pursue further the steps taken in the direction of peace. The letter is described as "très froide et très maladroite" (Zevort).<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>The inference implied throughout the preceding appears explicitly in a
letter to Frederick of the 19th of January. Drafted by d'Argenson, it was
revised and signed by Louis XV. The two hands and the two policies
are apparent in every line. "Our union, our strength and our efforts,"
d'Argenson wrote, "give us promise of victory and peace." Under the
hand of the King it became "must give us victory." As to Bavaria and
the Lower Rhine, "I am thinking of these two objects;" Louis appended,
"without forgetting Flanders." To the last line this odd dualism is
continued.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>This letter was written on the 19th of January. On the following
day a new chapter was opened with the death of the Emperor Charles
VII., after an illness of twenty-four hours.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> So far, two months of
d'Argenson's ministry have elapsed. Their history has revealed one fact
with impressive clearness. Upon the question of peace and the question
of war, there is a radical divergence of principle and policy between
the French Government and the French Minister. The King will listen
to no overtures which may thwart his desire of overrunning Flanders.
D'Argenson is earnestly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
desirous of peace, to be secured by a strong
defensive campaign in Germany. Which was the wiser will soon appear.</p>

<p>The death of the Emperor (January 20, 1745) was perhaps one of the most
terrible blows which French policy has ever sustained. It came at a
moment when fortune had turned to the side of the Austrians, and when
every step lost by France was a tenfold gain to Maria Theresa.</p>

<p>Louis XV. had been disposed for war; he found that he had no longer
the power to choose. It is true that for the French ministry there
were two conceivable courses; but only one was practically open. It
was conceivably possible to make terms with Maria Theresa, and to use
the death of the Emperor as an excuse for withdrawing from the war.
Such doubtless was the view of the trampled German populations and of
the tax-burdened householder of the faubourgs; but it could only be
maintained by sacrificing every principle of honour and policy, and by
ignoring the only considerations which would weigh for a moment either
with Louis XV. or Maria Theresa.</p>

<p>For the French King the course was marked out with terrible clearness.
He had combined with other powers to rend the inheritance of a
defenceless woman; and now, when that woman had faced him, uncrowned
but veritably imperial, to beg forgiveness on his knees&mdash;the very
thought was impossible. Nor could the King of France yet bow before
his former vassal of Lorraine. Even if his enemy deigned to listen to
him, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
would have to take or leave humiliating terms; and it would
be a cold return for that generous jubilation with which his people
had greeted him a year before. But not only were his own honour and
popularity concerned; there was another motive, to which he perhaps
may have been less sensible. To accept a peace upon any such terms as
Maria Theresa would be willing to grant would have been to inflict a
blow upon the future of French foreign policy, from which it might not
recover for half a century or more. The last would have been seen of
French influence in Central Europe: the upstart of Brandenburg would be
swept into the sea: two centuries of effort might be totally erased:
and Maria Theresa would resume the throne from which Charles V. had
descended. If not to the King, to d'Argenson at least, such a prospect
was at once conclusive.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>And when looked at from Vienna, peace was equally distant. As well seek
to recall a falcon striking its prey as to breathe of peace to Maria
Theresa. A statesman to her finger-tips, she saw at once that the two
objectives of the next campaign were Frankfort and Breslau. Her armies
were already on the plains of Breslau: her armies were within striking
distance of Frankfort: if but for a few months the breeze would hold,
the Flemish towns might fall to whom they pleased. And the path of
victory was the path of vengeance. She regarded the man who had failed
to wrong her, not, as is said, with the spleen of a woman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
but with the proud wrath of a queen; she had not
forgotten that he had driven her from her capital, and forced her
to throw herself on the generosity of the men her own fathers had
oppressed; nor would she have been slow to tender him the bitter cup
from which she had drunk.</p>

<p>She might indeed have listened to him upon one condition&mdash;the
abandonment of Frederick to her vengeance. In June last she had sworn
that she would never lower her sword against the man who had torn up
the Treaty of Breslau, until her generals could dictate terms to him
from Breslau. Proposals on behalf of Frederick&mdash;she would have trampled
upon them, as she trampled upon the Treaty of Hanover in August, when
presented to her by her ally of England. In a word, the French King had
to choose between indelible dishonour and the disdainful rejection of
his terms.</p>

<p>If these reasons were decisive to the King, they were not less so to
d'Argenson himself.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> No man longed so much as he for peace; but he
was not prepared to purchase it with the humiliation of his country,
and with the undreamed aggrandisement of that hated House against
which, all his life, he had consistently inveighed. The provinces were
henceforth to be beaten with scorpions; for the efforts of France had
been as nothing to that which the new enterprise would involve. Yet
cost what it might, the effort must be made; and d'Argenson was at
one with the Council<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> in the hope that by a single brilliant and
advantageous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
campaign, France and Frederick might establish a position from which an
honourable peace could be obtained.</p>

<p>The first necessity was to restore to their cause the moral basis which
had been struck from beneath it by the death of the Emperor. Henceforth
the pretext&mdash;for it proved to be little more&mdash;was to vindicate the
liberty of election, and to support a candidate acceptable to the
Electors. For the candidature of the Empire, the choice fell upon
Augustus III., Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, who at this very
time (January, 1745) was negotiating a secret treaty with Maria Theresa.</p>

<p>At this juncture, whatever may be said of it afterwards, the Government
acted with promptitude and determination. Before ten days had elapsed,
the position which seemed to Frederick "une crise terrible" had been
faced, the débris of a great policy had been swept to one side, and
before a courier could go and come between Paris and Berlin, the new
measures contemplated by the French Government were announced to
Frederick.</p>

<p>In a letter of the 31st of January&mdash;if not before it&mdash;d'Argenson
declared that "at the present moment the very idea of peace must be
forgotten," and the most strenuous steps must be taken to secure the
alliance of the King of Poland.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> This policy was reiterated in
letters of the 1st and 4th of February;<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> and from now until the eve
of the election at Frankfort, a desperate effort was maintained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
to induce Augustus to abandon Austria,
and to declare himself a candidate for the Empire.</p>

<p>The conduct of the negotiations fell into the hands of d'Argenson.
His own share in the policy is difficult to determine. He knew there
was really no choice; but he could not help seeing that on every side
it was beset with difficulties. It was true that the King of Poland
could scarcely resist the magnificent prize held out to him; and it
was not to be supposed that mere personal animosities could obliterate
every consideration of interest and honour. In that view the Minister
concurred with the Council; and he was supported by Valori,<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> the
French envoy at Berlin, who was deputed to approach the Court of
Dresden. To French statesmen the opinion was just and natural enough.</p>

<p>Yet d'Argenson at least, though he viewed them undaunted, was by no
means blind to the difficulties in the way. The jealousy of Russia in
regard to Poland, the formidable rage of the Queen of Hungary, and
above all, his hatred and jealousy of the King of Prussia, would all
combine to deter Augustus from committing himself in the interest of
France. Indeed so small was d'Argenson's confidence of success, that he
was unwilling to follow the Council in their resolution to subsidise
the King of Poland, and to guarantee to him by treaty an accession
of territory to be obtained at the cost of Maria Theresa.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> However
unpromising, the negotiation had to be begun; there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
was no alternative; and if it came to nothing more,
it would at least give time for the development of a campaign, and for
the armies of France and Prussia to achieve a position which would
serve as the basis of an honourable peace.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>If at Paris the plan seemed practicable enough, at Berlin it was
regarded from a very different standpoint. French statesmen could
consider nothing but the strength of their four armies, the excellence
of their intentions, and the splendour of the position to which
Augustus would be raised by the arms of France and Prussia. To
Frederick the matter presented itself in a less encouraging light. He
knew his neighbour of Saxony; he knew that Augustus had no resources
of his own; that his ministers were in sympathy with Austria and in
the pay of England; and that what might leave Paris as the offer of
an empire would reach Dresden as nothing more than an invitation to
Augustus to throw over a sound alliance, to place himself at the mercy
and become the tool of a covert enemy and a doubtful friend, and in a
word, to resume the position from which Charles VII. had been happily
liberated by death. Frederick saw at once that the French policy
was foredoomed, and he did his best to impress upon the cabinet the
fruitlessness of its task.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Finding his representations received as
merely the suggestions of prejudice and jealousy, he had no alternative
but to give way; and on the 13th of February<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> he announces that he
has "buried his resentment,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
and sanctioned the departure of Valori for Dresden.
Frederick was perfectly confident that Valori could only fail;<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> and
he felt that any apparent success which he might gain, would be by
no means useless in another direction in which his own efforts were
actively engaged.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>If the hopes of France were illusory and her policy unsound, they were
certainly not more so than the course which Frederick had himself
adopted. On the 26th of January, before any definite communication
had reached him from the French Government, he had instructed his
representatives to sound the ministers at London and the Hague;<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
for a consideration received he offered to withdraw from the war,
and to co-operate in the election of the Grand Duke. His agents were
instructed to press these proposals.</p>

<p>That Frederick could have had any real confidence in these measures,
it is difficult to believe. It is true that in England the Hanoverian
party was no longer in power; but George II. was bent upon the war,
and Carteret's influence was still supreme; moreover, popular feeling,
while demanding a change in the direction of the war, was by no means
in favour of its abandonment. Whatever the dispositions of the English
ministry, from Maria Theresa there was nothing to hope. Indeed the
whole plan was a counsel of despair. Frederick had everything to gain
and absolutely nothing to offer; he had incensed the whole of the
Austrian party; and if there were no motives of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
interest to aid him, he could scarcely trust
to motives of charity. Indeed the whole situation is summed up in
some words of Chesterfield to the Prussian minister at the Hague: "I
understand," he said, "the truth is you ask everything and you offer
nothing, for Silesia is no longer yours, since you have yourselves torn
up the treaty which gave it you."<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>It is easy to see the very natural motives which actuated Frederick
in the adoption of his policy.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> On the 31st of January, before
the measures contemplated by the French Government had yet been
communicated to him, he wrote to Louis XV. describing the position of
their cause in Germany in terms of very real concern. He spoke of the
utter dejection into which their allies had been plunged by the death
of the Emperor, and of the favourable positions secured by the Austrian
party; and he declared that only by the immediate reinforcement of
the French army in Bavaria could the young Elector be prevented from
"throwing himself into the arms of the Queen of Hungary."</p>

<p>It was probably with some surprise and not a little relief that he
received the news of the French determination to continue the war.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
He was already, as we have seen, in communication with London and the
Hague; but he could not help feeling how slender was his hope in the
intervention of the maritime powers; and he was wise enough to know
that peace, when it came, would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
be the less precarious for being secured by a
successful campaign.</p>

<p>That this was his feeling in the matter is clear from the attitude
he maintained towards France during the next two months. While
hoping desperately for the intervention of England, he neglected no
opportunity of concerting measures for the future of the war. Until
the re-opening of the campaign in Flanders, Louis XV. was besieged
with letters, memoirs, requisitions of all sorts, demonstrating
with unfaltering precision the critical positions which had to be
maintained, and insisting upon the only measures by which the French
policy could be carried to success, and the French allies preserved
from ruin. He made it clear<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> that a majority in the Electoral
Diet could only be secured, and the influence of the Austrian party
destroyed, by the most vigorous action on the part of the two French
armies in Bavaria and on the Main.</p>

<p>It had not remained for the King of Prussia to indicate the only
means by which the French policy could be executed or excused. Even
before the death of the Emperor, as we have seen, d'Argenson had
been convinced that the readiest way of obtaining peace was not by a
brilliant invasion of Flanders, but by a strong defensive campaign
in Germany.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> He now saw that every consideration in favour of his
policy had gained tenfold in weight; and about the middle of February,
probably upon hearing of Valori's difficulties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
at Dresden, he presented to the king a certain
memoir setting forth a plan for the future campaign.</p>

<p>This memoir is of the last importance.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> It strikes the key-note of
d'Argenson's conduct during the year 1745; it illustrates, as nothing
else can do, his real position in the Ministry; and it alone can
explain his subsequent attitude with regard to Frederick and Prussia.
As this document is very rare, and as it only exists by a fortunate

gens intéressés à faire paraître des opérations militaires plus
brillantes que solides, n'ayent conseillé à préférer ce côté-là à
d'autres. Vous y occuperez, il est vrai, les forces des puissances
maritimes, et quelques-unes de l'Autriche; mais ce n'est qu'une
diversion; et <i>l'on ne recourt aux diversions que quand on ne peut

<p>"Si V.M. y a des grands succès, je veux qu'elle puisse pénétrer

<p>"L'année dernière, Votre Majesté ayant débuté par des conquêtes

passage du Rhin par le prince Charles qui y obligeait; cette
année-ci ce sera l'élévation du grand-duc comme empereur qui y
forcera.</p>

<p>"L'objet principal est l'Allemagne; tout en dépend, même
l'établissement de l'infant don Philippe en Italie. <i>Pour parvenir
à la paix</i>, Votre Majesté a trois objets à soutenir: (1) <i>de
maintenir le roi de Prusse en Silésie</i>; (2) d'empêcher l'élection
du grand-duc, et de procurer l'élection de la couronne impériale
au roi de Pologne avec une grande facilité; sans quoi, <i>il n'en

qu'il a paru à la fin de la dernière campagne.</p>

<p>"<i>En Italie encore une défensive</i>, malgré ce qu'en pourront dire
les Espagnols, pour bien assurer les Gênois, les mettre à l'abri
de toute attaque, défendre par là le roi de Naples, et tenir en
échec le roi de Sardaigne, qui même ne pourra se soutenir à la
longue, s'il n'est point soutenu des Autrichiens; et si l'on
trouve jour à entamer le Piémont, qu'on y avance autant qu'on
pourra; qu'on avance dans le Milanais et le Plaisantin, si l'on
peut; <i>mais qu'en Allemagne nous faisions nos plus grands efforts</i>.</p>

<p>"Que Votre Majesté se porte incessamment à Strasbourg avec son
équipage de guerre, pour aller ensuite commander celle des deux
armées, qui promettra d'avoir le plus de succès et de sécurité
pour la personne sacrée de Votre Majesté.</p>

<p>There are many striking suggestions to be found in this memoir; but it
may be scrutinised in vain for any evidence of that doubt, hesitation,
looseness of grasp, by which d'Argenson's conduct is too readily
explained; while, on the contrary, we have only to read it in the light
of the measures actually taken by the French Government to detect the
real foundation for those charges: and to know how much weight it is
necessary to attach to them in so far as they concern the Marquis
d'Argenson.</p>

<p>We have only to read the above memoir with any of those prepared by
Frederick, and to sketch the chain of circumstances which took Louis to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Fontenoy, to be in possession of all the threads of
the long complication of 1745.</p>

<p>In a memoir of the 6th of March,<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Frederick represents that if
the election of the Grand Duke is to be prevented, a majority in
the Electoral College must be regained; if that is to be done, the
communications between Hanover and the three ecclesiastical Electorates
must be severed by the vigour of the army of Maillebois; and the
decisive movement must come from the army of Bavaria, which, under
vigorous command, must capture Passau, march upon Vienna, and by
drawing off the Austrian troops, throw open Moravia to the Prussian
army. He does not mince the meaning of his proposals.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If another course is taken in this war, the King of France will
reduce his allies to the necessity of withdrawing from it as best they
can; for there must be a prompt end to this, and the matter must be
decided one way or the other before the imperial election."<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Frederick's communications
with the French Court are one long reiteration of this demand. Never
did a man plead more eloquently the cause of reason and manliness; and
never was eloquence more desperately sincere.</p>

<p>The action, not of the French Minister, but of the French Government,
is almost incredible. They had deliberately embarked upon a great
policy, and they deliberately refused to take a single step by which it
could be realised. All that depended on d'Argenson indeed, was done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
as strenuously as man could do it. He exhausted
himself in efforts to win over the King of Poland, trampling down
or shutting his eyes to the obstacles which faced him; and he never
relaxed in his entreaties to Frederick to second his efforts at
Dresden.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Will your Majesty consider that by this alliance, if it
should ever take place, we should become absolute masters of the
situation."<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p> <p> ... "If your Majesty cannot lay aside the feelings which
alienate him from the King of Poland, I see only the prospect<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> of a
long war, the Grand Duke Emperor, and the Empire turned against us,
whatever efforts we may make."<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>D'Argenson might beg and entreat, and write despatches: but he was
powerless to enforce his words with the weight of his little finger.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
On the 10th of March he drafted a reply to Frederick, in which he
undertook that the army of Bavaria should be reinforced and should push
the war with vigour. The reply never went to Berlin; it remains marked
with the words "n'a pas servi."<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Indeed the French policy was already
decided. For no political reason whatever, the King had set his heart
upon a campaign in Flanders; and to that desire his own interest, the
interest of his allies, and every statesmanlike consideration must
of necessity yield. He was not likely to meet with resistance from
Noailles, still less from Count d'Argenson or Maurepas; and the Foreign
Minister stood alone in fruitless opposition to this brilliant piece of
political fatuity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>The effects of it were apparent already. The arms
of France were paralysed in Germany in order that troops might be
concentrated in Flanders; the army of Bavaria could not be reinforced;
little could be done for the army of the Main; and d'Argenson, while
persistently demanding ready co-operation in his overtures at Dresden,
was obliged to evade and trifle with the equally persistent demands of
Frederick. His position was a very thankless one; and it would have
been as ridiculous as it at first would seem, had it been of his own
choosing. That it was not, there is ample evidence to prove.</p>

<p>From this anomalous disposition of the French Government the four
decisive events of the year 1745 descend in lineal succession. Each
was a political disaster of the first magnitude; every one of them was
richly deserved, and not one was really attributable to the Minister
who has ordinarily borne the burden and the blame. Those events
are&mdash;first, the loss of Bavaria; second, the Convention of Hanover;
third, the election of Francis I.; and fourth, the Treaty of Dresden.</p>

<p>It was on the 21st of January that the young prince Maximilian
succeeded to the Electorate of Bavaria; on the 19th of April he signed
a convention with Maria Theresa.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>The Emperor on his death-bed had adjured his son to rely on the support
of France;<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> and Chavigny, the French minister at Munich, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
ready to assure him that he would never do so in
vain.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> The Austrian troops were already in Bavaria; repeated warnings
were given both by Frederick and Chavigny of the critical position
of the young Elector; and every means of persuasion was exhausted by
Chavigny in order to secure the reinforcement of the Bavarian army.
The French Government were deaf to his representations; the Council
rejected d'Argenson's despatches;<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> d'Argenson himself was at last
irritated at the reiteration of demands with which he had no power
to comply.<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Chavigny had to pacify the Elector with promises and
assurances, in default of troops.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile no effort was spared by Maria Theresa to detach the
Elector from the League of Frankfort.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> Her diplomatic agents were
Colloredo and Count Batthiany. Colloredo negotiated at Munich with
humiliating terms of peace; Batthiany advanced upon Munich with an army
eleven thousand strong, before which Ségur, with a small French force,
had withdrawn to the Bavarian frontier. Accordingly, Chavigny and the
Elector fled to Augsburg, where, on the 19th of April, a treaty of
peace, dictated by the Austrian envoy, was signed by Maximilian.</p>

<p>The event of the 19th of April was the signal for what M. de Broglie
himself calls "the breakup and rout of all that in a greater or
less degree was still holding to France."<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> The Prince of Hesse, the
Elector Palatine, the Duke of Wurtemburg,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
and the Electors of Trèves and Mayence were at no pains to conceal
their view that the French cause in Germany was lost; while the Elector
of Saxony, Augustus himself, the very man upon whom for three months
the efforts of French diplomacy had been centred, made haste to summon
the troops of France to withdraw from the soil of the Empire, where
there remained no excuse for their continued presence.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>Such was the disaster d'Argenson had foreseen and endeavoured vainly
to avert. He is said<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> to have cherished with blind fatuity an
unfounded faith in the fidelity of Bavaria. That faith was more than
justified, if we are to believe Chavigny, who said that up to the very
day when the unhappy Elector was forced to abandon his capital to the
Austrians, he remained firmly attached to the French alliance.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> The
truth is this: that not only at Munich, but at Dresden and Frankfort,
d'Argenson's action must appear ridiculous; because, while prosecuting
his negotiations with energy and enthusiasm, he was unable, through no
fault of his own, to give them the weight of a single cannon-shot. In a
word, the bold policy of the 31st of January, while actively prosecuted
by the French Minister, was tacitly abandoned by the French Government.</p>

<p>Of that fact Frederick needed no further evidence than the Convention
of Augsburg. His mind was made up. He saw at once that the real object
of that Government was, not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
protection of German liberties, not the election of the King of
Poland, not a decisive war and an honourable peace, but simply a
holiday campaign in Flanders. He was utterly exasperated by the vain
selfishness of the French policy, while his impatience at its continued
tenderness for Saxony mounted to the brim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We are on the eve of a new war," he wrote to Louis XV., a fortnight
after the loss of Bavaria, "and what I want to know is this: Is Your
Majesty going to declare himself for a prince who is giving auxiliaries
to the enemies of France, or for the man whose diversion disentangled
Alsace; does Your Majesty prefer the artifices of a crafty and secret
enemy to the frankness of an honest friend, who has drawn upon himself
the whole burden of the war, and whose provinces are now only being
ravaged in order to secure the sweets of tranquillity to the subjects
who live under French dominion. In a word, I must know if the justice,
the honour, the generosity of Your Majesty can consent to leave me
without the real assistance which He is bound by treaties to render,
and to sacrifice me to a prince who has dethroned Your Majesty's
father-in-law, a prince who is sold to the enemies of France, and who
is only awaiting the favourable moment to give vent to his hatred and
animosity against her."<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He gives the French king to understand that for the purposes of the
common cause, the siege of Babylon will be as useful as the siege of
Tournay;<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
and in despair of producing any effect, he concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It is simply in the force of his own arms and in the fortune of
battles that the King of Prussia puts his greatest trust, in the hope
that the goodness of his cause and the valour of his troops will never
fail him."<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He sees but one remedy for the crisis produced by the loss of
Bavaria&mdash;the immediate invasion of Hanover by Conti, with the army of
the Main.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>This advice was a marvel of astuteness. He saw that with the
abandonment of France he had nothing further to hope from the war;
and that his only resource lay in bringing pressure to bear upon the
maritime powers, and extricating himself as best he could. He proceeded
to do so, needless to say, without the least compunction. To Frederick,
the difference between the open rupture of an alliance and the tacit
abandonment of an ally, was one for a casuist and not for a statesman.
Events deepened his determination. Decided by the fall of Bavaria,
Augustus on the 18th of May had ratified the Treaty of Warsaw arranged
in January with Maria Theresa;<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> and on the 4th of June, a combined
army of Austrians and Saxons strayed into the "trap" which Frederick
had spread for them at Friedbourg.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> On the 11th of May, Louis XV.
had reaped the utterly vain glory of Fontenoy; and shortly afterwards
Conti, upon the Main, received orders to detach twenty thousand men for
the army of Flanders.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> The Statesman at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Vienna seized the opportunity to unite her armies
in Bavaria and Franconia, and Conti, menaced by superior forces,
withdrew with his troops beyond the Rhine.<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> There was not a Frenchman
left in Germany; and the army of the Empress closed round Frankfort.</p>

<p>At the end of an ironical letter of compliment to the French king,
Frederick writes (August 25th):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It is a pity that in such a fine picture there should be one blot to
spoil it a little. I speak of the retreat of the Prince of Conti. It
is he who crowns the Grand Duke, and places Your Majesty's allies in a
desperate and fatal position."<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>From that position Frederick was determined to escape; but his success
would have been more than doubtful, were it not that at this very
moment, a critical conjunction of untoward events softened the obduracy
of George II. The French advance in the Low Countries, the clamour of
the peace party, and above all, the sweeping success of the gallant
Prince Charles Edward, forced King George to listen to terms.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> If the
English troops were to be withdrawn from the Continent, Hanover could
not be left at the mercy of Frederick; and only by the suspension of
arms in Silesia, could a force be drafted from the Austrian army to
relieve the English in the defence of Flanders. A determined effort was
made to induce Maria Theresa to consent to a pacification. She would
have nothing whatever to do with the traitor of Brandenburg; nor would
she listen to any proposal which would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
involve the withdrawal of a single man from the
Silesian frontier.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> In the meanwhile time pressed; Charles Edward was
marching on Edinburgh; and on the 26th of August, the King of England
signed the Convention of Hanover, guaranteeing, for himself and his
allies, the suspension of the war and the maintenance of Frederick in
Silesia.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>If Maria Theresa had rejected, three weeks before, the proposals
presented to her by her ally of England, she was not more likely to
recognise the Convention signed by England upon her behalf. On the very
day when Robinson, the English envoy at Vienna, endeavoured to obtain
her acceptance of a treaty which snatched her enemy from her grasp,
she received the news<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> that the long conflict she had maintained so
manfully had ended at last in triumph, and that her husband, the Grand
Duke of Tuscany, had been elected Emperor at Frankfort.</p>

<p>This election took place on the 3rd of September. It shattered once
for all the diplomatic combinations which the labour and enthusiasm of
d'Argenson had endeavoured singly to sustain. To crown the catastrophe,
he was abandoned by the man to whom everything had been sacrificed;
for the King of Poland, a few days before, declared in favour of the
Austrian candidate.<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> At the very moment of this palpable collapse of
French influence in Germany, the air became heavy with rumours of the
withdrawal of Frederick from the French alliance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>It is no easy matter to determine d'Argenson's real share in these
events; but it seems clear that whatever tone be assumed in regard to
it, it cannot be that of harsh contempt.</p>

<p>At a terrible crisis in the beginning of the year, he had acquiesced
in the adoption of a daring policy; he had discerned the measures by
which alone that policy could be realised; and he had endeavoured,
in conjunction with the greatest of the French allies, to enforce
them upon his colleagues. He had seen those measures, one by one,
deliberately and wantonly rejected; and the policy which could only
be maintained by a couple of armies was left him to support without a
single man. Inevitably his time was spent in apprehending disaster, in
futile attempts to hamper its approach, and in transparent efforts,
when it came at last, to give it the appearance of success.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> In a
constitutional government he might have resigned his place, declining
the responsibility for measures which he had no power to control. As
the minister of Louis XV., such a course was impossible. He might again
have refused to pursue his negotiations at Dresden and in the several
Electorates; but to have done so would have been to deprive the French
intervention of its only possible pretext. A third course would have
been to shrug his shoulders, tear up the policy of January last, and
accept his share in the unprincipled by-play which was the only form
that French diplomacy in Germany could reasonably take. He had simply
to choose between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
acting like a knave, and looking like a fool. The
qualities requisite for the former part he had never been able to
acquire; and he had a profound faith that knavishness was the very last
attribute of a statesman. In short, his only resource was to believe,
in spite of himself, that there still remained some serious possibility
of success, to shut his eyes to ominous circumstances, and to clutch at
every shred of hope. By dint of trying to persuade others, he succeeded
at last in persuading himself. He lost sight of the fact which had once
been clear to him, that to Frederick mere protestations of confidence,
with nothing to support them, were not worth the paper they were
written on; and he clung to the belief that the suave indecisions of
the Court of Dresden were more than a diplomatic veil for an absolute
refusal. So it was that when the disasters he had foreseen occurred in
due course, he found that it was less easy to accept than to apprehend
the inevitable; and the Treaty of Hanover and the election at Frankfort
came to him as a cruel blow. In a sorrowful letter to Marshal de
Belleisle he says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I have received your letter. As to what you say
of me, I must say nothing, and with good reason; I fear your praises
more than any man's, for I know your sincerity. Nevertheless, I cannot
believe that I have the least capacity for affairs, where, up to the
present, I have had so little success."<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowing as we do in how slight a degree d'Argenson was himself
responsible for these disasters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
we can only be impressed by the touching readiness
with which he was content to accept the blame. For eight months he had
been in as thankless a position as was ever occupied by mortal man. His
representations had been neglected; his despatches had been revised or
rejected by the Council; deprived of means, his enterprises had been
doomed to failure; and it was only by his own enthusiasm and devotion
that they had been maintained so long as they were. If on occasion he
had been blindly credulous, there were occasions when only by blind
credulity could his position be maintained at all.</p>

<p>It was by a courier from the headquarters of Prince Charles's army
that the news of the treaty which guaranteed to Frederick a suspension
of arms was conveyed to Maria Theresa.<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> She at once communicated
with Count Brühl, the all-powerful favourite at Dresden. Immediately
afterwards (September 10th), the Saxon minister placed in the hands of
the French agent a draft of the Convention of Hanover, and gave him
to understand that if France desired to be avenged upon her faithless
ally, she would not be repulsed at Vienna.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>The French Ministry was at once placed in possession of this startling
news; and it was resolved, by a majority of the Council, that
negotiations should be opened at Dresden with Maria Theresa.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> The
feeling against Frederick was at fever-heat.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>D'Argenson's time had come at last. He had opposed without success
the resolution of the Council; but his own credit had fallen with the
defection of the man whose fidelity he had guaranteed. Nevertheless, he
knew that persuasion was the least of his resources; and he resolved
that it should be no fault of his if anything came of the overtures of
the Empress.</p>

<p>His position is clear. It was not for nothing that for twenty years
he had studied and thought upon public affairs; he was as deeply
versed in the interests of the kingdom as the rest were skilled in the
intrigue of the Court. The meaning of the Austrian proposals was not
mistaken for an instant. Maria Theresa, roused by the thought that her
enemy was escaping, had resolved to sacrifice her lesser hate; and
by making terms with France, even at the cost of some of her Belgian
provinces, to set free an army, forty thousand strong, for service in
Silesia. D'Argenson knew the meaning of that; it would be all over with
Frederick II.</p>

<p>The prospect suggested two questions. In the first place: Was it just?
Had Frederick deserved the fate to which the French Council were ready
to abandon him? D'Argenson had only to recall his correspondence with
Prussia during the spring, the loss of Bavaria, and the retreat of
Conti, to satisfy himself that if France had at last been abandoned
by Prussia, she had only herself to blame. But there was a further
consideration. Was it wise? and to that question d'Argenson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
alone in the French Ministry was capable of desiring or conceiving the
answer. To the rest, to Noailles or Maurepas or Count d'Argenson, the
paltry personality of the month or of the moment, the time-killing,
time-winning shuffle or shift, was the decisive factor in politics.
D'Argenson's statesmanship had a broader base. It had regard, not to
the interest of his place or to the opinion of de Pompadour, but to
the interest of his country and the tradition of Richelieu. He alone
could weigh the gravity of the course the Council undertook so lightly.
He alone could see that so long as the Prussians remained in Breslau,
France would be sure of a powerful ally, and the right hand of Austria
would be paralysed in Europe; while, upon the other hand, if Frederick
were compelled to bow before fate and Maria Theresa, the heiress of
Austria would draw the sword of Charles V. against her own enemy and
the enemy of her House. Months before, d'Argenson had revealed his
feeling in one of those master-sayings of depth and directness, which
only tend to strengthen the belief that his history deserves to be
re-written. At a not dissimilar crisis he declared:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We must not listen, we must not even permit a word of such a thing. If
the Low Countries were offered to me, I should believe them too dearly
bought at such a price as this. You have to make it clearly understood
that His Majesty is resolved never to stand by and see this prince
despoiled of what has been ceded to him by his treaty with the Queen
of Hungary at Breslau in 1742; and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
His Majesty would prefer to surrender the dearest interests of his
realm than ever consent to allow this prince to be deprived of Silesia
and the county of Glatz."<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is the saying of a man who is not easy to understand, but who is
worth the trouble which the attempt involves. To put his attitude in
a word, he regarded Silesia as strategically the most valuable of the
French provinces. He would have preferred almost to sacrifice Lorraine.</p>

<p>The Council, in arriving at the above resolution, had reckoned without
the minister who was to carry it into effect. At this juncture
d'Argenson found that the very circumstances which had paralysed his
efforts in the beginning of the year were telling powerfully in his
favour; for the anarchy prevailing in the French Government was such
that the only means of positive action open to any of the ministers
was in the frustration of his colleagues' designs. To that task
d'Argenson addressed himself with right good will. In transmitting his
instructions to Vaulgrenant, the French envoy at Dresden, he allowed
him to understand that if he could only succeed in failing, his failure
would not go unforgiven.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> The Austrian majority in the Council
were by no means unanimous; and their different resolutions were
communicated to Vaulgrenant without the faintest attempt to reconcile
them.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I agree that the matter is one of some difficulty," wrote
d'Argenson; "M. de Vaulgrenant will get out of it as best he can."<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Above <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
all, he made the ambassador clearly understand
that he was to listen to no proposal which would tend to deprive
Frederick of Silesia, well knowing that with that object only had the
Empress been induced to treat at all.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> In fact, Vaulgrenant could not
possibly mistake the tone which the minister desired him to assume.</p>

<p>In this enterprise d'Argenson found a powerful ally in the man whom,
in the beginning of the year, he had endeavoured vainly to assist.
Frederick had achieved one of his master-strokes. Upon hearing of the
Convention of Hanover, Maria Theresa had formed a daring design. She
resolved to ignore the approach of winter, and to concentrate her
troops in Saxon territory for a direct descent upon Brandenburg. The
plan was concerted secretly with Augustus, and the Saxon army would act
with the Austrians.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> At the close of the regular campaign Frederick
had returned to Berlin. His sword had clicked again in the scabbard,
his hand had fallen nerveless from the hilt, when suddenly a stray word
let fall at a dinner-table by Count Brühl was conveyed carefully to
Berlin; tensely the fingers closed upon the hilt, the sword leapt forth
again bare and terrible, and at the end of a three-weeks' campaign,
which we cannot even read of now without dancing eyes and tingling
blood, the lion of Brandenburg entered Dresden.</p>

<p>It was through streets strewn with the red work that the Austrian
envoy, on the verge of desperation, made his way to the house of
Vaulgrenant,<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
whom he found but moderately willing to listen
to proposals in doubtful favour with the ministry at home, and to
the prejudice of the man who might sleep that night in the capital
of his fallen enemy. The conference was without result; it was never
resumed.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> Through the combined efforts of d'Argenson and Frederick
the whole negotiation had come to nothing; and Maria Theresa had no
alternative but to sign with Frederick the Treaty of Dresden. By this
treaty the Convention of Hanover was confirmed. Frederick was free to
withdraw from the war, and he was again recognised as sovereign of
Silesia.</p>

<p>This was the last great blow which French policy sustained during the
year 1745. Frederick had broken finally with France. Months before,
when the position had first been suggested by the news of the Treaty
of Hanover, d'Argenson had conceived his policy in regard to it. He
knew better than any man the real causes of Frederick's defection; and
deplore it as he might, he saw no reason for enlisting Prussia among
the enemies of France. He had expressed his thought in a letter to
Belleisle:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We must leave him alone; he will remain neutral; he will deceive the
Queen of Hungary as he deceives everybody else; he will continue to
cause her uneasiness until the general peace, and it is his interest to
do so; he will oblige her always to keep an army in the neighbourhood
of Silesia.... We can retain his alliance by interest, or at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
least by a certain understanding which prevents him
hurting us, and which will be useful to us in many ways." "In fact, as
he told the Prussian ambassador as soon as the Treaty of Dresden was
known, he regarded Prussia as henceforth the political centre of French
interests in the Empire and in the north."<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So concludes this study of the position really occupied by d'Argenson
with regard to the political events of 1745. It is not without reason
that it has been dwelt upon at length; for the period embraced seems
immeasurably the more important of d'Argenson's ministry. The principal
events of the following year are really no more than episodes, loose,
and comparatively of little weight. In 1745 however, we have a long and
connected series of incidents, affording an extended view of the rival
policies; and furthermore, we are brought directly into contact with
the great political question of the day, the question suggested by the
growing change in the relations of the German powers.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is upon his action during this period that the severity
of criticism in regard to d'Argenson's ministry is mainly based. To
accept that criticism as conclusive, it would have been necessary to
obliterate every impression suggested by his life before and after.
There was no alternative but to examine it; and if we have sometimes
been compelled to challenge the positions of MM. de Broglie and Zevort,
it is with a diffidence due to authorities so distinguished. Yet no
diffidence need
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
disguise the result. So far as d'Argenson
personally is concerned, each historian supplies the material for
questioning the conclusions of the other: and at the same time for
conceiving a third, in harmony with d'Argenson's known character
and opinions. So far as we can see, neither writer has examined
these events with reference to any general scheme of policy in
d'Argenson's own mind; the forms that happened to be impressed upon
that policy by the accidents or circumstances of the moment appear
to have been mistaken for the policy itself&mdash;a process which, for a
man in d'Argenson's position, would efface the distinction between
statesmanship and imbecility. Moreover, he has frequently been held
responsible for events over which he had no control whatever; and in
M. de Broglie's case, failure to appreciate or sympathise with him
is aggravated by personal opposition to his measures; and about the
whole account of his ministry, equable as it is, there are unwelcome
suggestions of Marshal de Noailles.</p>

<p>It is unpleasant to seem to speak so lightly of those to whom one
owes so much; and it is no further necessary. The conclusion remains
that during this period d'Argenson had a clear and statesmanlike
policy; that thwarted and crossed at every turn, he did what little he
could to realise it; that he was forced by the defection of his own
government into a false and even ridiculous position; and that, in the
circumstances, he acquitted himself as worthily as any man could be
expected to do.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>
<p>In the following year, 1746,<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> the course of French foreign politics
is fortunately plain and simple. D'Argenson's position is clearly
marked, and it has been treated with what appears to be substantial
justice.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>The year presents three striking episodes. It opens with a strange
attempt and a still stranger failure, it is distinguished by at least
one marked success, and it closes with a curious comedy of intrigue of
which the <i>dénouement</i> was d'Argenson's disgrace.</p>

<p>It was not the chance or the exigency of the moment that led to the
famous Negotiation of Turin. We can scarcely say how long d'Argenson
had dreamed of the liberation of Italy;<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> but for years past he had
clung to the idea with something of the fervour of a religious faith.
It was the one indulgence in the luxuries of idealism of which he
refused to deprive himself. The hope was an inspiring one, and not a
year had elapsed since his accession to the ministry, when he began his
famous attempt to realise it.</p>

<p>The key to the position was held by the King of Sardinia. Sardinia, in
alliance with Austria and in the pay of England, was the great barrier
against the Bourbon advance in Italy. To seduce Charles Emmanuel from
the cause of Maria Theresa would have been to cripple the Austrian
power in Italy; to induce him to turn his arms against his late ally
would have ensured her expulsion from the peninsula. There was only one
danger to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
feared. In Spain, with the Italian branches of the
Spanish Bourbons, the House of Savoy had a deadly enemy; and d'Argenson
had predicted years before<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> that the whole project might be ruined
by the resistance of the Court of Madrid. He was only reassured by
the reflection that in her foreign relations, Spain was ultimately
dependent upon France, and that a French minister of firmness and
courage would be able to bend her to his will.</p>

<p>In September, 1745, d'Argenson approached the Sardinian Government with
certain remarkable proposals. He suggested a territorial re-arrangement
of Northern Italy, the expulsion of the Austrians from the peninsula
by the combined forces of France, Spain, and Sardinia, and the
constitution of the various states as an Italian confederation. These
overtures were coldly received, the Piedmontese minister representing
that their practical effect would be to draw down upon Sardinia the
vengeance of Austria and of the whole Empire. The defeat of Bassignano,
the progress of the Bourbon arms, and the danger which menaced the city
of Alessandria, modified the dispositions of Turin. The negotiations
were resumed; and proceeded so far that on the 26th of December the
partition of territory designed by d'Argenson was accepted by the
Sardinian Government, though the idea of an Italian Confederation was
still repulsed. On the return of Champeaux,<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> the French agent, from
Turin, arrangements were rapidly made for the conclusion of the treaty;
and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
on the 20th of January, Champeaux again set out
from Paris as minister plenipotentiary, charged to obtain a final
settlement within two days. Coincidently the Spanish Government was
apprised of the negotiation, and its adhesion was required within the
same time. Meanwhile, at the instance of Montgardin, the Sardinian
envoy, d'Argenson wrote to Marshal de Maillebois, in command of the
French army in Italy, acquainting him with the situation, and warning
him to remain upon the defensive until the conclusion of the treaty.</p>

<p>While the preliminaries were being signed at Turin, the reverses of
Prince Charles Edward freed the English Government from a pressing
embarrassment; and on the very day (December 26th), the conclusion of
the Treaty of Dresden enabled Maria Theresa to detach thirty thousand
men for the army of Italy. The Sardinian ministers began to repent of
the haste with which they had listened to the French overtures; they
saw that they had embarked upon a desperate venture, in which it would
be folly to persist; and henceforth their only care was to obtain an
armistice which might enable them to relieve Alessandria and to improve
their military position. Finding that in the proposals upon which
Champeaux was demanding a final answer, the preliminaries of the 26th
of December had been extended, they refused to accept the extension,
and they demanded that in case the Spanish Government failed to accede
to the treaty, the menace with which Louis XV. had tried to influence
it should be made a definite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
stipulation, and the French troops
withdrawn from Italy at the end of two months.</p>

<p>The news of the proposed treaty was received at Madrid with passionate
outcries. So far from consenting within forty-eight hours, Philip V.
addressed to his nephew an indignant letter of remonstrance; and a
special ambassador was despatched to Paris with orders to check the
progress of the negotiation. At first the treaty had been kept an
absolute secret between d'Argenson and the King; but it was now a
subject of popular rumour, and it became necessary to communicate it to
the Council.</p>

<p>A storm of opposition was at once let loose, and feeling the King's
resolution wavering, d'Argenson resolved upon a decisive step. On the
17th of February, relying upon the good faith of the Court of Turin, he
signed the armistice between France and Sardinia.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Sardinian plans were complete. The great Austrian
reinforcement was approaching Mantua; the Piedmontese army was ready
to march, while Maillebois, trusting to his instructions, remained
inactive, and without a suspicion of the event which was preparing.
He was soon undeceived. His son, who was in charge of the armistice,
received a letter warning him not to approach Turin unless he was
prepared to make the concessions demanded by the King of Sardinia,
to raise the siege of Alessandria, and to declare the armistice
immediately. This Maillebois was unable to do; he was supplied with
passports, and informed that on the following morning (March 5th) the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Piedmontese army would be put in motion. A few days afterwards eleven
French battalions were surprised at Asti, and their surrender opened to
the Sardinian troops the road to Alessandria.</p>

<p>Exactly two days before, the prolonged resistance of the Spanish Court
yielded to the determination of d'Argenson; and Philip V. and Elisabeth
Farnese accepted the Treaty of Turin. They were soon to hear that the
plan they had striven so obstinately to frustrate had been destroyed by
the perfidy of Sardinia itself.</p>

<p>The news of the fall of Asti created consternation at Paris; and a
host of d'Argenson's enemies, headed by Noailles and Maurepas, were
only too eager to fasten the blame upon the Foreign Minister. The King
was carried away by the tide of reaction; and after the fashion of
weak men, he rushed to the opposite extreme. Everything was done to
propitiate Spain. Noailles was charged with a special mission to the
Spanish Court, where he used his opportunities to decry the Minister;
and most fatal step of all, the commander in Italy, Maillebois, was
instructed, for the rest of the campaign, to yield the initiative to
the Spanish generals. The two armies were divided by jealousies and
suspicions; the Austro-Sardinians pushed their advantage; and by the
end of the year the French were driven to the borders of Provence and
the Austrians entered Genoa.</p>

<p>Such was the famous fiasco of Turin. The project was doomed from
the beginning. The whole history of diplomacy could afford no more
intricate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
play of cross-purposes. Not one of the parties to the
negotiation understood the position of the rest; and it was only by
a masterly comprehension of its own that the Sardinian Government
escaped with success. Upon the conditions of the attempt and the causes
of its failure it is unnecessary further to enlarge. For the present
purposes it is principally important as perhaps the one event in the
whole course of d'Argenson's ministry for which his responsibility is
clear and decided; and it is the one event which plainly reveals his
greatness and weakness as a practical statesman, and displays the very
qualities and defects a previous knowledge of him might have led us
to expect. That matter may be dealt with more conveniently when our
impressions of his ministry have to be reviewed.</p>

<p>It was one of d'Argenson's political convictions that French influence
in Germany was to be best established by refraining from provocation
of the German powers. Throughout the winter of 1745 he was engaged in
a series of tedious negotiations with the various Electoral Courts,
designed to secure the neutrality of the Empire. His plans were
successful; and he was able, with the co-operation of Frederick and
of Maurice de Saxe, to banish the war entirely from Germany, and to
confine it to Italy and Flanders. The conduct of these measures has
secured the commendation of his most critical historian.</p>

<p>There remains to be considered a curious series of events, which
serves to illustrate the peculiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
relations subsisting in the French Government, and the embarrassments
by which statesmanship was beset.</p>

<p>In July, 1746, Philip V. of Spain died; and the event was followed
immediately afterwards by the death of his daughter, the Dauphine of
France. The new king, Ferdinand, was strongly desirous that the young
French prince should espouse the sister of the late Dauphine; and the
proposal was supported by a powerful party at the French Court, at the
head of which were Noailles and Maurepas. The project was distasteful
to Louis XV., and it was rejected, ostensibly upon religious grounds.
It is suggested that d'Argenson's qualms were occasioned, not by an
access of unwonted scrupulosity, but by the hope of repairing the
disaster of Turin by the betrothal of the Dauphin to a daughter of
the King of Sardinia.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Louis was favourable to the scheme, and
negotiations were actively begun; but the determination of Sardinia to
press her advantage in Italy led to their suspension.</p>

<p>It was then resolved to demand in marriage the daughter of Augustus
III. of Saxony. The enterprise proceeded with singular rapidity, and
d'Argenson is proud to record it as the most striking of his diplomatic
successes. Yet on the very day on which the marriage was celebrated at
Dresden, the apparent author of it was disgraced.</p>

<p>The reason is as remarkable as the fact itself. Throughout the
negotiation there were two policies at work, one of which was entirely
unknown to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
French minister. D'Argenson had conceived certain
bold and statesmanlike views with regard to the position of Saxony. He
hoped to bring about an understanding between Saxony and Prussia, and
by the combined influence of France and Prussia, to make the crown of
Poland hereditary in the Saxon house. By so doing it might be possible
to withdraw Augustus III. from his blind dependence upon Vienna and
St. Petersburg. The first step in the realisation of this plan must
be the ruin of the Saxon minister, Count Brühl, a sworn partisan of
Austria. The other policy was that of Count Brühl himself. He proposed
to take advantage of the French overtures in order to bring about an
understanding between France and Austria, and so to use their combined
forces for the destruction of the rising power of Prussia. The first
step in furtherance of the scheme must be the ruin of the Marquis
d'Argenson, a firm ally of Prussia.</p>

<p>In fact, the negotiation of Dresden resolved itself into a personal
duel between Count Brühl and d'Argenson. It ended, as we know, in
the triumph of the former, through the intervention of his great
compatriot, Maurice de Saxe.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> The victor of Raucoux had recognised
a strong personal interest in the proposal to make his niece Dauphine
of France; and unknown to d'Argenson, he had exerted his powerful
influence in favour of it both at Versailles and Dresden. Having
nothing further to gain from the war, he was easily persuaded to second
Brühl's scheme for the mediation of Saxony; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
being given to understand by the Saxon minister
that the real obstacle in the way of an arrangement was the "faux
système"<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> pursued by the d'Argensons, he resolved to do his best to
compass their fall. On the 10th of December he wrote to Brühl:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"People here are beginning to suspect that the d'Argensons have no
sincere desire for peace. There is a shell planted; and if we apply the
fuse, they will be blown into the air.... I have sounded the Marquis
with regard to that question you spoke of last. He is unwilling to
listen to any proposals on behalf of the Court of Vienna, and talks
upon that matter in a very strange fashion."<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maurice proceeded to apply the fuse. He won over Madame de Pompadour,
between whom and the Foreign Minister there was no love lost;<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> and
he engaged his friend and d'Argenson's enemy, Noailles, to use his
influence with the King. Accordingly on the 15th of December Noailles
submitted to Louis XV. a famous memoir,<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> in which d'Argenson's
ministry is elaborately represented as one long disaster: his portrait
being drawn with a bitterness of party spirit and personal animosity
but thinly disguised by an affectation of disinterestedness. D'Argenson
was by no means unaware of the intrigues against him; but he would
not stoop to defend himself. He thought that his position had been
strengthened by the successful negotiation of the Saxon marriage, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
which he imagined he had the sole honour; and he
believed himself secure in the confidence of the King. The latter, who
seems to have regarded d'Argenson with unusual esteem, succumbed to
the importunities of the Favourite, the Courts of Saxony and Spain,
the all-powerful Maurice de Saxe, the Council of ministers, and every
one whom d'Argenson, to relieve his soul or to protect the public, had
found it necessary to offend; and on the very day on which what seemed
to be a brilliant diplomatic stroke was consummated at Dresden, the man
who imagined himself the author of it was dismissed.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of his fall was his obstinate refusal to traffic
with Austria, or to sacrifice what generations of experience had
taught him to regard as the interest of France to the fortuitous
prepossessions of a foreign adventurer.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p>We can form no just estimate of d'Argenson's capacity as a statesman
without some clear ideas of his position as a minister. He had entered
office burdened with two disabilities, the cause of which it has been
the most important of duties to lay bare. He had no aptitude for
court intrigue; he had no power of confronting opposition and sternly
frowning it down. Unable to win, he neglected the courtiers; unable
to coerce his enemies in the Ministry, he was only too happy to avoid
them. He was forced to rely upon the value of his services, and upon
the esteem and confidence of the King. That he managed to secure that
confidence, and to preserve it even at the moment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
his fall, there is ample evidence to show. Relying
upon the royal support, he did not hesitate to enforce those principles
of policy which research and reflection had led him to embrace.
He determined, so far as possible, to make his will felt; and the
incapacity with which he was charged by Noailles and the anti-Prussian
party in the Council was really incapacity to accept proposals at
variance with every statesmanlike tradition. Without regard for the
consequences to himself, he acted for what he thought to be the public
interest&mdash;a process which no French statesman could then pursue without
offending innumerable susceptibilities, and uniting every one, from
the reigning favourite to the most insignificant chargé d'affaires,
in a league of enmity against him. They all combined to convict him
of incapacity and indiscretion; he passed among the courtiers as
"Dunce d'Argenson";<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> and his eccentricities of manner gave occasion
to caricatures which were carefully gathered up by that consummate
chronicler of the unimportant, the Duc de Luynes. The persecution was
too bitter to be inspired merely by contempt; and we have only to read
the letters of Noailles and Saxe to know that they were directed, not
to the dismissal of an incapable minister, but to the removal of a
statesman who barred their path.<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>In his public life, d'Argenson is distinguished rather for what he
might have done than for anything he did. In 1745 he was, as it has
been necessary to show, in no sense responsible for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
policy of France; while throughout the year 1746
his position was being undermined in all directions. There was,
however, at least one transaction for which his responsibility is
clear and undivided. His conduct of the Negotiation of Turin displays
in brief the character of the man, and the peculiar qualities of his
statesmanship. It reveals one capital defect, the defect of one who has
been long accustomed to look upon the world through his own eyes. He
made a fatal mistake in attributing his own motives to the Sardinian
Government, and in imagining that it would consent for a national ideal
to hazard its present and material interests. He did not see that in
offering the King of Sardinia the hegemony of the Italian states, he
was inviting him to accept the desperate part which had been played
by Frederick in Silesia; and that, though the reward would indeed be
brilliant, it was far too distant and uncertain to be readily sought
by the Government of Turin. The defect, grave as it was, proceeded
chiefly from lack of the experience, which a man like d'Argenson can
only gain through the terrible bitterness of a first disappointment.
We have only to consider the incident further to see that no man
ever compassed disaster with so many of the qualities which make for
success. The scheme was distinguished by grandeur of conception, and
in pursuing it the author gave proof of decision and intrepidity.
Incidentally he achieved one triumph of which any statesman might be
proud. His dealings with Spain were a monument of reasoned daring and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
determination; and the acceptance of the Treaty of Turin by Elisabeth
Farnese is the most striking tribute that could have been paid to
d'Argenson's political capacity. It is true that he was carried away by
an enthusiasm which a longer experience would certainly have chastened;
and that he courted disaster by endeavouring to accomplish in three
weeks the work of thirty, or a hundred and thirty, years. Yet his
callow temerity was not ignoble; and French diplomacy can boast of few
more honourable failures.</p>

<p>France owes to d'Argenson one lasting debt. He strove, as gallantly
as ever man could, to arrest the disintegration of French policy.
His determination to adhere to the anti-Austrian tradition embroiled
him with his colleagues in the Ministry, and became the occasion of
his fall; while it has been made the principal ground of impeachment
by certain writers of his own country. He is charged with having
sacrificed the substantial interests of France to his blind prejudice
in favour of Prussia; and with having refused to recognise the new
problems created by the decline of the Austrian House. Such criticism
must not pass unchallenged.</p>

<p>It cannot be too clearly remembered that to French statesmen in 1745
the decline of Austria had not yet begun.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> Fondly had they dreamed of
the ruin of her dominion; they woke up to find that in the person of
Maria Theresa the Hapsburg dynasty had renewed its youth. The Austrian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
succession had been maintained in arms; and it
would never even have been questioned had it not been for Frederick's
seizure of Silesia. As to Frederick himself we have to beware of
misconceptions; for in much of French criticism with regard to him we
recognise the impressions of 1763&mdash;or even of 1870. No one suspected
what was in the man, and it was not until December, 1745, that people
began to think of him as "the Great." Only three months before the
campaign in Saxony, which won from his people and wrung from his
enemies that noble salutation, he was described by the oldest of
his admirers, d'Argenson himself, as "a man who <i>might have been
great</i>."<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>
It was not until after the Treaty of Dresden that he
ceased to be looked upon as merely an able and unscrupulous prince who
had wantonly provoked the resentment of his neighbours, and who had
only to be abandoned by his one ally to receive the punishment his
insolence had deserved. When, in the previous September, the Empress,
at the cost of some of her Flemish provinces, offered to purchase the
withdrawal of France, neither she nor d'Argenson mistook for a moment
the real meaning of the proposal. In all human probability Frederick
would have been doomed. Those who suggest that the "traitor of Hanover"
should have been abandoned to his fate, forget the sublime capacity
for vengeance with which men like Frederick are endowed. If such a man
had yielded to the Empress the sword of Prussia, it would have been to
receive it back as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the sword of the Empire. The Imperial troops,
headed by the Prussians and commanded by the victor of Friedbourg,
would have marched to wrest from the common enemy his ill-gotten
provinces of Flanders and Lorraine; France might have taken the place
of Saxony, and the pride of Paris been bitterly rebuked a hundred years
before the time. D'Argenson may not have seen all this; but he was a
statesman and a thinker, and he was wise enough to know that such cheap
successes as the Empress offered him are often the very dearest of all.
With an admirable moral courage, he maintained that nothing Frederick
could do, no treason he might contrive, could lessen the interest
of France in maintaining him in Silesia; and he would not allow the
resentments of a month to obscure the tradition or the teaching of a
century.</p>

<p>In maintaining his policy, d'Argenson had to struggle against the
irresistible current which was carrying the Monarchy to destruction.
Since the death of Louis XIV., private convenience had been the only
criterion of national interest. Dubois and Fleury, for their own
purposes, had dismantled the tradition of French foreign policy; and
though an effort had been made to re-establish it by Chauvelin and his
pupil d'Argenson, their work could not long stand against the forces of
disintegration. After d'Argenson's withdrawal no further attempt was
made, and he lived to see the complete surrender of those cherished
principles he had striven so bravely to maintain. D'Argenson admired
and reverenced Richelieu; and he has been laughed at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
for aspiring to be his worthy successor.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> Banished from power until the age of fifty,
he could never attain the eminence of his master. He could only defend
for the last time the policy which that master had bequeathed to France.</p>

<p>His defence was in vain. The collapse abroad heralded the collapse at
home. It was only in 1789 that the French Monarchy surrendered its
charter to the French People. It had resigned it, thirty-three years
before, into the hands of Maria Theresa.</p>

<small>1747-1757.<br /><small>
A momentous decade&mdash;The Journal&mdash;Private life.</small></small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was on the 10th of January, 1747, that d'Argenson's ministry came
to an end. For a year or so he found it a little hard to support
his banishment from power; but it is plain that after that time his
personal ambitions were gradually forgotten amid the press and play of
wider interests. It is true that he never quite dismisses his hopes of
office, and that he even fondles the pretty, courtier-like phrase with
which he will accept an invitation to return; but there is none of the
ardent, even feverish anticipation which clouds the period before his
ministry; and we feel that when he speaks of his own prospects it is
with the smiling, tranquil air of a man who is fond of pleasant dreams.
He was far from being unhappy. The ten years that preceded his death
were a period when a man of d'Argenson's character will desire rather
to watch than to work.</p>

<p>Though his outward life meanwhile was devoid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
 of incident, it was
inwardly full of stir and excitement. Throughout these years society in
France was passing through the most critical of all its phases. Men's
veins were tingling with that new wine with which the old bottles were
already bursting; while across the history of the time is writ the word
of omen&mdash;Revolution. It is this that lends to d'Argenson's pages such a
vivid power and fascination.</p>

<p>The chief interest of his retirement was the composition of that
Journal which is, and which he evidently designed to be, the most
important commentary on a momentous period. He spared no pains to
obtain direct and definite information, securing correspondents at the
Court, in the Parlement, in the army, and in every department of the
public service; while in handling events he added to the industry of
the chronicler the grasp and acumen of a political expert. It is from
these pages that we catch the impression of d'Argenson's power. We feel
that a man cannot act in one year like a blind, blundering doctrinaire,
and write like a statesman in the next. It may be useful to glance very
lightly at the history of the time as it appeared to one of its most
sagacious observers. In doing so we are in the hands of a cicerone who
is not satisfied to speak by rote.</p>

<p>In December, 1747, after speaking sorrowfully of the national
prospects, d'Argenson writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Will any one have the hardihood to propose an advance towards
republican government. So far as I see, the people are utterly unfitted
for it; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
nobility, the great lords, the tribunals, accustomed
as they are to servitude, have never turned their thoughts in that
direction, and they have no inclination of the kind. Still these ideas
are coming, and a habit is readily formed among the French."<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two years after these words were written a profound change had taken
place. The terms of the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle had created grave
discontent; and it was fanned to the heat of fury by the news that the
idol of the Parisian populace, the English Prince Charles Edward, was
to be expelled from France. His violent arrest at the doors of the
Opera aroused bitter indignation, which d'Argenson shared.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This 'garrotting' will be an eternal disgrace for France. We shall
be put, no doubt, by the side of Cromwell, who beheaded his king. For
no purpose whatever we have garrotted the lawful heir to this Crown.
Nay more, he had been useful to us, and we were indebted to him for an
effective diversion which placed Brussels in our hands. It will be long
before people have done talking of this" (December, 1748).<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>People did more than talk. The event gave rise to some of the most
venomous tirades that indignation ever wrung from helplessness; and
curiously enough, it was the starting point of that alert and violent
opposition which vexed the country for forty years. The excitement
occasioned by it had not subsided when a renewal of the great struggles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
between the Crown, the Clergy, and the Parlement,
gave a new motive to popular passion. The clergy refused to administer
extreme unction to those who had not accepted the Bull Unigenitus;
they were opposed by the resolution of the Parlement of Paris; the
Crown interfered on behalf of the clergy; and Church and Crown united
their forces in an endeavour to coerce the Parlement. At the same time
the attempt of the Controller-General Machault to force the vingtième
upon clergy and people alike united the Church and the Parlement in
opposition to the Crown. The Crown, incapable of pursuing a policy of
its own, allowed itself to be buffetted between the two parties; it was
regarded with alternate scorn and fury; and popular feeling rallied in
support of the outraged Parlement of Paris. The Church too was feared,
hated, and afterwards despised;<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> and every day added to the influence
and prestige of the rising party of Enlightenment.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>D'Argenson's attitude throughout the controversy may be summed in
a single word. He was with the Parlement against the Church, and
with both against the Crown. It is often an occasion of wonder that
Machault's proposal to bring the clergy under the ordinary fiscal
arrangements of the realm should have met with such violent opposition.
In a single sentence d'Argenson reveals the reason:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"These pamphlets" (for proving "that the King has the whole right and
jurisdiction over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
property of the clergy") "have been unfavourably
received, their cause, their object, being nothing but money, the need
of money, the Treasury already so full of money, the Ministry appearing
to think so little of relieving the burden of the people, the Court
spending right and left; and not a wise reformation of the clergy. That
is the thing to excite the people against the soundest principles."<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such a passage alone is sufficient to show the deep distrust into which
the Government had fallen. The organ of that distrust was the Parlement
of Paris. D'Argenson at first had trembled for its existence; he soon
saw that the forces behind it were irresistible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In the general commotion," he writes, "the Parlement of Paris has
nothing more to fear. The entire nation is rising in opposition to
ungoverned and arbitrary will, and they have the Parlements at their
head" (April, 1752).<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So acute an observer could not fail to see that the most alarming
features of the struggle were the indirect results which it might
produce. It had scarcely begun when he devoted to it one of the boldest
and most penetrating of all his reflections.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I am afraid that all this, if pushed too far, may produce some great
outbreak. Men may arise who, under colour of the clerical cause, will
sustain the cause of the nation. With little merit or ability of their
own, these men will obtain influence, they will secure the affection of
the people. Let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
no one say that such men exist no longer. The
statue is in the block of marble; the meanest of men will rise to the
occasion. Even to-day mark how many writers there are of learning and
enlightenment. For some years the wind has been blowing from England
upon these materials; the materials may catch fire. Look at the tone
of the remonstrances against the vingtième prepared by the Parlements
and the Estates. These Attorneys-General of Parlement, these syndics
of Estates, such might be these great men I speak of; the whole nation
might catch fire, the Nobility throwing in its lot with the Clergy,
and afterwards the Third Estate. If the result were that it became
necessary to summon the States-General of the Realm, they would find
occasion to regulate the finances and the demands of money for the
future. Those Estates would not assemble in vain. Let the men in power
have a care; they would be very much in earnest" (December, 1750).<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>D'Argenson's apprehensions were soon confirmed. A year later he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"To-day the popular mind is occupied with this approaching revolution
in the government; people talk of nothing else, and every one is full
of it, even the bourgeois" (November, 1751).<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Among high and low the feeling was the same.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The evil consequences of our absolute monarchy are finally persuading
every one, both in France and throughout Europe, that it is the worst
of all forms of government. Among men of enlightenment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
(<i>philosophes</i>) I hear nothing but the confident
assertion that even anarchy is to be preferred to it; for it leaves to
each inhabitant at least the enjoyment of his property, and whatever
disorders or acts of violence may occur are to the prejudice of private
people only, and not, as now, to the body of the state" (September,
1752).<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These eight years of clamour and coercion, violence and weakness,
produced a very profound impression upon French society, and upon
d'Argenson himself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The opinion of the nation is gaining ground, and may lead us far. It
is remarked that never until to-day have the names of 'Nation' and
'State' been so frequently in use. Under Louis XIV. these two names
were never pronounced, and people had no idea even of their meaning.
Never has knowledge of the rights of the nation and of liberty been so
widely diffused as it is to-day. Even I, who have always made these
matters the subject of thought and study, had a very different mind and
feeling with regard to them. The change is due to the Parlement and the
English" (June, 1754).<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This last word suggests one final reflection, which is prompted by a
hundred passages of d'Argenson's Journal, and which, to us at least, is
of singular interest. Ten or twenty years before, Frenchmen had been
proud of their own government, and had laughed at that of England as a
masterpiece of absurdity. After 1750 a change
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
took place. It was not that they had begun to
admire the English constitution or the balance of powers commended
by Montesquieu; of that they knew little and comprehended less. What
they were impressed with was none other than that very spirit of noise
and turbulence and apparent disorder which they had before regarded
with contemptuous wonder. As they watched their country outstripped
in the race, they came to feel that there was some virtue in a rude
independence: and that the government of England, anomalous as it
appeared, was consistent with national honour and prosperity. If it
be allowed, in deference to French protest, that the influence of
English philosophy upon the Revolution was slight and circuitous, it
is no less true that the influence of the English people and polity
was rapid, powerful and direct. In fanning the glow of revolutionary
feeling during these seven or eight years at least, the comparative
excellence of the English government was only less operative than the
worthlessness of the French. It is a fact of which we hear very little,
but with which d'Argenson at any rate was deeply impressed.</p>

<p>Interlocked with the political battle, there proceeded a spiritual
conflict of far more broad renown. Again light had become darkness;
and out of the darkness came the world-old cry, "Let there be Light!"
Again with d'Argenson's bright intelligence may we watch the movement
of emancipation.</p>

<p>He gives us momentary glimpses of men then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
painfully struggling into fame, and now as illustrious as their enemies
are obscure. Here is the great Encyclopædist, as he first appeared to
d'Argenson:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The man Diderot, author of the obscene book 'Bijoux Indiscrets' and of
the 'Aveugle clairvoyant,' has been examined in prison at Vincennes.
He received the magistrate with the pride of a fanatic. He was told
by the person who examined him that he was an insolent scoundrel, and
would remain there for a long time. This Diderot, when arrested, had
just finished the composition of a surprising book against religion,
entitled 'Le Tombeau des Préjugés'" (August, 1749).<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>"Buffon, the author of the 'Natural History,' is beside himself with
apprehension at the success of his book. The devout party are furious,
and mean to have it burnt by the hand of the hangman. It is quite true
that it contradicts Genesis completely" (December, 1749).<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>"Voltaire writes here that he is much pleased with his residence in
Prussia. He says he means to show how cleverly he can live with all
the world, since he is on the best of terms with the father of the
faithful&mdash;(the Pope, whose letter he has had printed at the head of his
tragedy of 'Mahomet')&mdash;and with the father of heretics, the King of
Prussia" (April, 1751).<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>"Jean Jacques Rousseau of Geneva, a pleasing writer and a would-be
philosopher, says that men of letters should take these three vows, of
poverty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
freedom, and truth. That has prejudiced the
government against him; he expressed these sentiments in certain
prefaces; in consequence he was spoken of in the private apartments,
and the King observed that it would be a good plan to have him locked
up in Bicêtre. His Serene Highness the Count de Clermont added that
it would not be a bad thing to let them give him a sound thrashing
as well. People are afraid of these free philosophers. My friend
d'Alembert is one of them, and he is threatened with the reprehension
of our state Inquisitors. The Jesuits are the prime movers in this
system of inquisition" (April, 1753).<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the very centre of light and learning, this Jesuit influence was at
work. Here is a little picture of an election to the Académie Française:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Buffon, whose 'Natural History' is at present under examination by
the Sorbonne, and d'Alembert, of the Encyclopædia, are withdrawing in
fear of being suddenly branded; there will remain none but fools to
elect. I am acquainted too with Bougainville, who hoped for a place
but is suspected of Jansenism: and with the Abbé de Condillac, the
metaphysician, who, however, has spoken too freely of the soul....
It seems that everything is being done to establish the Inquisition
in France; and the more our priests are hated, the more hateful they
manage to make themselves" (June, 1753).<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To-day, penetrated with the power and impalpability of the spirit, we
have lost faith in the arm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
of flesh. To d'Argenson however, it seemed as
though the Unholy Office establishing in France would flourish as
fatally as its Spanish prototype.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"'Lettres de cachet' have been issued against the Abbés de Prades
and Yvon; the rumour runs that they are also out against Diderot,
the principal author of the Encyclopædia. Woe to the enemies of the
Jesuits! The French Inquisition is increasing in extent and power; it
is now to be reinforced by the bigotry of the Court.... Woe to the
honest men who go about their business and are sound of heart and mind,
but who are not sufficiently careful to control their tongues when
speaking of light and liberty!" (February, 1752).<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Among the "honnêtes gens tranquilles, qui ne maîtrisent pas leur
langue," none had more reason to tremble than d'Argenson. For some
time a remarkable political work of his<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> had been circulating
quietly among the Philosophic party; and his religious opinions were
at least as licentious as any to be found even among the clergy.<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>
By political profession he was an adherent of the Gallican Church; by
private conviction he was a deist after the manner of Voltaire, but
with none of Voltaire's apostolic bitterness. Deist or Gallican, he was
a confirmed enemy of obscurantism in all its forms.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> His habitual
attitude towards it is prettily illustrated in the following passage:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"At last we shall see a ridiculous censure of the Sorbonne upon the
'Esprit des Lois' of President de Montesquieu, for they hold it to
contain many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
things contrary to revealed religion. This condemnation will be a
positive scandal, for the 'Esprit' is a philosophical book universally
admired, and honourable to our age and nation. This Sorbonne, which
is now no more than a carcass, will remind one of Fat John remonstrating
with the priest of the parish; and revealed religion will suffer through
its interference, instead of gaining by it" (March, 1753).<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The great movement was in its infancy when d'Argenson died; but he
lived long enough to see that there was much in the old society besides
the Sorbonne<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> which was "now no more than a carcass." He tells us how
Madame de Pompadour invited Diderot and d'Alembert to resume the work
upon the Encyclopædia which their Jesuit enemies had been unable to
continue: and his reflections from time to time enable us to measure
the growing influence of the Philosophic leaders. In May, 1754, was
written this eloquent tribute to their advancing power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It is averred that everything is preparing in France for a great
reform in religion. It will be a very different thing from that rude
Reformation, a medley of freedom and superstition, which came to us
from Germany in the sixteenth century. Both have been brought about
by the intolerable tyranny and avarice of the priests; but as our age
and nation are far more enlightened than that of Luther, we shall not
stop half way. Priest, priestcraft, revelation, mystery, all will be
banished;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
and we shall be content to see God through the
greatness and goodness of His works. It is in our own hearts that He
has written His law, His love, our gratitude, our hopes in Providence,
and our fear of its justice. As to the attributes of God, we are as
wise as the priests; we can adore Him by ourselves, and without the
help of these persons pious by profession, who call themselves the
ministers of the altar and who are only the drones of the hive" (May,
1754).<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And before blotting his page, he enables us to comprehend in a single
glance the parallel movements of the time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Soon with this reformation in religion will come the reformation
in government. Political tyranny is interlinked with ecclesiastical
tyranny. Against them are turned the two branches of the forward
movement,<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> the one in the direction of moderate democracy, the other
towards adoring God in mind and heart alone. We give up the attempt to
do anything more with these two forms of government, and in politics
and society we see matters as they ought to be.... Nature tells us all
that we need; we listen and follow her when the imposture of tyranny
exists no longer."<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have only to compare Citizen d'Argenson with the former Absolutist
of 1732 to realise the rate at which France was travelling.</p>

<p>If the revolution, political and moral, was the chief, it was not
the only interest of d'Argenson's Journal. His pages reflect the
many-featured life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
of a great and old society.<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>
We can only advert to his luminous criticism of economics and finance:<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
his strange apologies for the debauchery of the King: and the heart-sick
comparisons which he sometimes makes between the condition and
government of France and England. He beheld, with apprehension and
despair, the avowed resolution of the English nation to destroy the
colonial influence of France; he beheld, with astonishment and alarm,
the abandonment of the traditional French foreign policy by the Treaty
of Versailles in 1756. He was oppressed more than all by the critical
state of the interior. His descriptions of the French provinces are the
most striking examples of d'Argenson's power. They display, not merely
a mastery of facts, but a masterful hold upon their meaning; and they
are informed by the pure and unaffected habit of humanity which he had
learnt in an older than the Philosophic school. Again, "C'est par le
c&oelig;ur que son esprit est grand!"</p>

<p>Unkindly were it to lay down the Journal without a grateful reference
to d'Argenson's style. It is a vexed question, though all that is
necessary has long been said with the noble generosity of Ste. Beuve.
Those of d'Argenson's friends who were gifted with a pretty wit used
to tell him that he wanted style. What they meant was that he wanted
stylishness. In those days, before Buffon had let in light upon the
darkness, the meaning of style was very undefined. People used the word
to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
denote delicacy and refinement. To those qualities
d'Argenson could never pretend. His diction was of a heterogeneous
character, the language of polite society mingling with expressions
from the gutter or the farmyard, or places more unsavoury still.
The structure of his sentences is often erratic, and he is never
embarrassed by the importunities of grammar. Such necessary niceties
he regarded with unconcern, or as a mark of coxcombry or pedantry;
in learning and literature he hated both. What he valued was mother
wit; and he was content to express it in his mother tongue. He was not
inclined to cavil at a word which had been good enough for Rabelais,
nor was French the less French for being Tourangeau, as that great
master proved. Such licence however as he took, he could well afford
to take. D'Argenson's style resembles his statesmanship. Delicacy,
finesse, those smaller aptitudes that come by practice, he had never
been able to acquire; yet he displays no slight command of the larger
qualities of style. His writing wins us, not by the charm of symmetry
and grace, but by the kind of rude dignity which comes of will and
energy and power. He cleaves his way to his own meaning with a certain
two-handed effectiveness by no means unimposing; and we have never
to fear having lost one jot or tittle of the idea he is trying to
convey. Often ungrammatical, he is never obscure. The reader has
scarcely a knot to unravel in the whole nine volumes of his Journal.
Though unformed and unrefined by art, his literary instinct is of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
surest. He never misses the point of a story, or fails to convey it
to his readers. His handling of episodes, grave, sure and convincing,
compels the regret that he was not born poor, in order that he might
have achieved distinction as a master of style. But the binding charm
of d'Argenson is his perennial flow and freshness. Brisk, alert, ever
unwearied, his reader cannot weary of him. His vitality scatters the
dust from his pages, leaving them bright as the day they were written.
He is a foe, as ever, to pomp and ceremony; his narrative opens
readily, it closes with a clasp. He has none of St. Simon's breadth of
elaboration; yet he has something which makes us feel, as we lay down
the ninth volume, that we owe the writer no grudge, and that if life
were long enough, we would open a tenth with unblunted curiosity and
pleasure.</p>

<p>Indeed the style is a faithful reflection of the man&mdash;perhaps the
most faithful we possess. Known only through his acts, we know him
only as he was spoilt by his unhappy training. It is in his writings
that we see the real man, as he was by himself and as he strove to be
with others. In the world he was stiff, shy, rudely straightforward,
despising chicanery and abhorring clamour. Alone in his library he was
another being, free, natural, powerful, and great. From the windows he
could look out upon a world unthinking, heedless, the prey of knaves
and the sport of fools, and needing to be guided by a philosopher and
an honest man. His belief that he was wise and strong enough to give
such guidance may be called an illusion, if any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
one thinks it worth
while. Within those walls the illusion, if illusion it was, was a very
natural one; and natural or not, we have no right to complain, for
it has bequeathed to us one of the most interesting of journals and
revealed to us one of the most interesting of men.</p>

<p>D'Argenson's life during these last ten years is seen upon an engaging
background, the château and domain of Segrez, about thirty miles from
Paris. It was a very charming place, which its master loved, and was
fond of describing both with pen and pencil.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> He used to liken it to
the Elysian Fields,<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> and if his own affectionate sketches of it are
to be trusted, the hyperbole may readily be pardoned. There he passed
the years of his retirement, organising his correspondence, inditing
his Journal, entertaining his friends, and protecting the peasantry
against the revenue officers.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> Sometimes too in moments of blissful
idleness, he would prop himself up in that portable reading cabinet
which M. Aubertin has made so famous,<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> and laugh and weep through a
translation of "Tom Jones,"<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> a new book by that ingenious writer, Mr.
Henry Fielding. His life was broken by an occasional visit to the Court
or to his family estates in Touraine; and he was constantly in and out
of Paris. Often might he be seen descending from the mud-bespattered
coach, reading with affright and horror some placards which the police
had not yet torn down, condoling with one of his learned friends in the
agitated court of the Palais de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Justice, denouncing the Jesuits in the company of
d'Alembert, or hurrying away to preside at a meeting of the Academy of
Letters.<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> But his heart was always thirty miles away. We can picture
him, after an exciting month at Paris, arriving at Segrez, handing off
his cloak, flinging himself into the arms of some cherished chair, and
dreaming of a week of peace and solitude.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Here I am again in the country for six days. I shall have less news of
the world and the Court, but far better news of myself. How delightful
it is to be at rest, in the company of oneself and one's books!</p>

<p>"Yesterday evening there was a beautiful aurora borealis, and
immediately afterwards the weather cleared up and the wind veered round
to the south. There is good promise for the harvest. The rain came when
it was wanted, and the crops, kept back by the cold weather we have
been having lately, are now coming forward in fine style."<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this time d'Argenson presents a pleasant picture, the picture of a
man who has striven, and not in vain. He had not obtained all he had
hoped for, but what he had achieved was no little thing. It is easy
to have the defects of one's qualities; it is harder to acquire, as
d'Argenson had done, the very qualities of his defects. The vices of
his nature he had employed more usefully than many virtues. Cut off
from the many, he had won his way into the ranks of the elect; if he
could not be witty, he could at least be wise. Fortune had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
decreed his failure as a politician: she could not
deny him the secondary distinction of being, as a political thinker,
the foremost man of his time. And this was the end of a lifelong
struggle, not unworthy of his stubborn blood. True that he had faults,
and retained them to the last; and to the last he strove to quell them.
They were in spite of him; his greatness was his own. Faults though
they be, they are not unamiable; their generous admission extorts
generosity: and they have forgiven them most readily who have known
them best. If, under the pen of M. Edmond Scherer<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> and others less
distinguished than he, they have been raised to a hateful prominence
of contumely, they have been reduced to their due place of utter
subordination by the humanity and the insight of an Aubertin<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> and a
Ste. Beuve.</p>

<p>The Marquis d'Argenson died on the 26th of January, 1757. Rousseau five
years afterwards inscribed his epitaph&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not to be imagined that the man who watched so anxiously the
progress of the malady, and marked with such sensitive precision the
quickening of the pulse, could do so from a mere cold interest in
social pathology. D'Argenson felt the distemper as if it had been his
own. He was devotedly, even extravagantly patriotic; and his political
criticism might have been less pungent had the subjects of invective
been less personal to himself. He could have neither patience nor
charity for men who could fiddle while Rome was burning. Powerless as
he was, he was at least above that reproach.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>
<p>Seven years after d'Argenson's death there appeared a very remarkable
book. It was called</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">"Considérations sur le Gouvernement
de la France,"<br />

or<br />

"Jusqu' où la Démocratie peut être
admise dans le Gouvernement
Monarchique."</span>
</p>
<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p>It was written by him in 1737, the year of Chauvelin's disgrace. It is
upon this work or upon notices of it that d'Argenson's reputation as
a political thinker is principally based. It is necessary to examine
it carefully, and in the light of the circumstances under which it
was composed. The author would turn in his grave could he hear the
verdict which has generally been passed upon it; for if there was one
imputation which d'Argenson abhorred and strove to avoid, it was that
of being a visionary possessed by chimeras.</p>

<p>The consideration of this book is not so easy as it at first appears.
It is less known than it certainly deserves to be, and we are dependent
for our knowledge of it upon a couple of old editions, published in
1764<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> and 1784. The work consists of a number of dissertations on
the past history and present condition of the French Government, which
serve as the setting for its central feature, a Plan or project of
reform. In the preface to the edition of 1784, which was issued by the
d'Argenson family, the previous publication is noticed, and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
are told that it is grossly imperfect, and that
unwarrantable liberties have been taken with the author's text.
Upon consulting the earlier edition, the discrepancies are at once
apparent, and nowhere so noticeably as in the very Plan which is the
most important section of the work. To begin with, the Plan which,
in 1784, is given in the form of a royal proclamation in thirty-four
articles, appears in the issue of 1764 as an informal draft consisting
of fifty-two. And the difference is not of form alone; for on comparing
the two Plans we find that they are as far apart as are the poles
asunder, and that the second might represent, at the ordinary rate at
which history proceeds, a century's advance in breadth of thought. In
some bewilderment we turn to the four manuscripts preserved in the
Library of the Arsenal;<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> and confusion is further confounded by the
discovery that it is with the very Plan of this maligned edition of
1764 that that of the manuscripts coincides. The manuscripts themselves
are clearly authentic: for they bear annotations in d'Argenson's
handwriting. A question at once arises as to the authenticity of the
scheme of 1784. A comparison of the texts establishes the fact that in
spite of the impeachment of one editor and the apologies of another,
both editions are equally genuine, and represent different stages of
the work. Moreover it is evident that that of 1784 is mainly a revised
and enlarged version of the original, and was probably executed about
the year 1750; and further, that in it the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
editor, without a word of explanation, has
incorporated a Plan, a Chapter and a Conclusion, of much later date and
with a very different purpose.</p>

<p>The "Considérations," as written in 1737, is founded upon two
principles. D'Argenson felt that for the rapid and decisive action
which a great nation should be able to employ, a strong and united
government was necessary: and that in the Monarchy France possessed
such a government. He saw at the same time that that government had
charged itself with a multitude of minute concerns which it could not
possibly understand or supervise, and that consequently the rural
districts were neglected, and local administration throughout the
country was in a shameful state of nullity or disorder. He proposed
therefore to disband the great army of subaltern officials who worked
or shirked in the pay of the Sub-delegates, and with an emancipation
of thought which is truly astonishing, to hand over their duties to
popular control. With that object he devised the following scheme.</p>

<p>Henceforth the business of each city, borough or village (<i>ville,
bourg et village</i>), should be managed by a committee of the
inhabitants, to the number of five or more. Persons eligible for
service in that capacity should be nominated in an annual meeting
of the inhabitants; and the officers should be appointed from among
the nominees by, and at the discretion of, the Sub-delegate. The
latter, while ceasing to interfere directly in parochial concerns,
should maintain a general control and supervision, and should have a
discretionary power to displace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
the local officers for dereliction of
duty or other misconduct. In matters affecting more than one district
the local authorities might confer together, after specifying the
subjects of the conference, and obtaining from the Sub-delegate a
formal warrant. The national taxes should henceforth be raised in
the form of a communal grant, equal in amount to the sum hitherto
obtained from the taille; it was to be assessed upon the inhabitants
of the district by the local authority, and paid in by them to the
Financial Receivers, who should be, in addition to the Intendants and
Sub-delegates, the only royal officers. The reform should be introduced
gradually, and might be submitted to experiment in certain districts
in the neighbourhood of Paris, and in the wards of Paris itself.
In any attempt to introduce it, the authority of the Crown must be
scrupulously maintained.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>Such are the principal, and from a constitutional point of view,
the only essential features of the project of 1737. It is with this
scheme that M. Martin deals in his notice of d'Argenson. He concludes
a summary of it with a critical remark which is characteristic of the
tone not infrequently held with regard to d'Argenson and his proposals.
He says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Monarchy without nobility, without a judicial aristocracy, and without
a bureaucracy, royalty suspended without supports at an enormous height
above a democratic society&mdash;there is d'Argenson's dream: illusion of a
noble heart!" etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Un ministre stipule pour le Roi, mais il travaille et craint
pour lui-même.</i>"&mdash;"Considérations" (1764).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this judgment M. Martin displays somewhat less than his usual
acumen. Certain abusive privileges might have been touched: but not
a rank in the social hierarchy connecting the Crown with the tiny
democratic communities, would have been menaced by d'Argenson's
scheme.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> Moreover to speak of "Royalty" and "democratic society"
in connection with it, is to employ large words to describe what is
after all a very little thing; by using these wide and general terms
the idea is dilated and swollen till it becomes grotesque. What
d'Argenson proposed was simply to dismiss the score or so of clerks,
tax-collectors and hangers-on who managed parochial affairs under
the direction of the Sub-delegate without sympathy or regard for the
wishes of the people: and to transfer these affairs to a little parish
council, consisting, for example, of the neighbouring squire, the
village curé, a couple of farmers, and an erudite cobbler or so, who
would look after the roads, assist the poor, assess and collect the
parochial taxes, and attend to all matters which were not beyond the
capacity of half-a-dozen intelligent countrymen, guided and supervised
by the Sub-delegate. The two poles upon which the system revolved were
not "royalty" and "a democratic society,"<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> but in plain prose, the
bureau of the Controller-General at Versailles, and the parish room or
the inn parlour of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
village of Argenson in the "généralité" of Touraine. In fact we have
an almost exact parallel in the by no means fantastic relations which
exist in nearly every parish in England between the local School Board
and the Education Department at Whitehall.</p>

<p>It cannot be supposed, as M. Martin would appear to imply, that the
Crown and the Vestry could neither co-operate nor co-exist. D'Argenson,
in drafting his proposal, presumed upon both sides at least the average
amount of sense which is ordinarily devoted to matters of government.
So far as he could see, there was no reason why the parish councils
should ever dream of giving trouble; and he could not conceive any
Government perverse enough to provoke them to a national combination
for resistance. He imagined, on the other hand, that local affairs
would be managed better, and could not be managed worse, than they
were; and that in any case life would be awakened in the provincial
districts, and that they would be rescued from the torpor of death into
which they were rapidly subsiding. Surely this was something more than
the illusion of a noble heart.</p>

<p>It is entirely in accordance with the fitness of things that the
best criticism of d'Argenson's plan is that of one of his own
contemporaries, who was better able than any one now can be to
understand the difficulty which pressed for solution. Voltaire, as we
have seen, received the manuscript about eighteen months after its
completion; and his quick intelligence was in no danger of mistaking</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">"<i>Le temps de l'Aristocratie est passé quand le Despotisme<br />s'est établi
sans son secours.</i>"&mdash;"Considérations" (1784).</p>

<p>the meaning of his friend's proposal. He wrote to him:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It seems to me that you have elucidated in a consecutive system the
vague ideas and the heartfelt wishes of every good citizen.</p>

<p>"Is not England a standing witness to the truth of your ideas? The King
with his Parliament is legislator, as in France with his Council. The
rest of the nation is governed according to municipal laws, as sacred
as those of Parliament itself. The love of law has become a passion
among this people, because every one is interested in the maintenance
of the law. All the highroads are kept in order, hospitals founded and
maintained, commerce flourishing, without the necessity of a decree of
Council. This idea is the more admirable in that you are yourself a
member of this Council, and that in you the love of your own authority
yields to the love of the public good."<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was only one point on which Voltaire was at variance with his
friend; and its consideration will lead us to that other proposal for
which, nearly twenty years later, the present was abandoned by its
author. Before leaving this scheme of 1737 a few concluding reflections
have to be made.</p>

<p>To us in England at the present day this Plan seems a very modest
one; but we may readily forget the breadth of thought, the marvellous
political
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
instinct, which could have conceived it in the
France of 1737. To realise the depth of d'Argenson's discernment, we
have only to compare the "Considérations" with the famous book by
which it was evoked,<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> "L'Histoire de l'ancien Gouvernement de la
France." M. de Boulainvilliers and d'Argenson had been struck by the
same evils; but the former attributed them to the iniquitous usurpation
by which the people had been withdrawn from the protection of their
feudal lords, and subjected to oppression by the irresponsible minions
of the royal authority. His remedy was a reversion to the society of
the thirteenth century. D'Argenson's proposal was a very different
one. He saw very clearly that as a great political instrument the
French noblesse existed no longer; and that if local government was
to be reformed, the reform must come from the people themselves. If
these shopkeepers, peasants and the rest, had no political tradition
or knowledge, they were primarily concerned in acquiring it; and he
enunciates, perhaps for the first time, the great principle of all
democratic development, the principle that in matters of government
interest is more valuable than intelligence. Astonishing as it may
seem, he had perfect confidence in the men to whom he proposed to
entrust a modest share of influence and power: and he expressed it in a
few golden words which suggest the spirit of his scheme:&mdash;</p>

<p>Even to Rousseau, the tramp of genius, who had eaten black bread
and slept in cabins, the democratic faith came gradually and as an
inspiration; but what are we to think of the French nobleman who had
conceived it twenty-five years before as he talked with the labourers
round his château?</p>

<p>One of the most striking features of this Plan of 1737 is the care
which is taken to safeguard the royal authority. The local officers are
placed under the absolute control of the Sub-delegates, and the unit of
popular action is nothing more formidable than the parish or the ward.
"<i>Divide et impera</i>" was the legislator's device. To us who have daily
experience of the harmonious working of local and central institutions,
this solicitude may appear a little singular. To d'Argenson however it
was not so. His devotion to the Crown was hereditary; and he shared the
belief in the sovereign virtues of monarchical government which was
held unanimously in 1737. Any project which would tend in the slightest
degree to impair the authority of the Crown, could neither be proposed
by him nor listened to by others. It was this point which drew from
Voltaire his only suggestion of dissent. The poet had been travelling
in England and Holland; and his natural reverence for the Monarchy had
been qualified by an acquaintance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
with republican societies. He had very little
faith in Louis XV., and he expresses the real weakness of his friend's
proposals in a single trenchant line. D'Argenson had averred<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> that
when the King has nothing to think of but governing, he will always
govern well.</p>

<p>"Well then," exclaims Voltaire, "for God's sake let the King think of
governing!"<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
</p>

<p>At that date, with the history of Louis Quatorze behind him, and before
him his hopes of Louis Quinze, d'Argenson could have no uneasiness upon
that score. It took twenty years of experience of the Monarchy at close
quarters, of further knowledge of the actual principles by which it was
conducted, to show him how far and fatally the reality fell short of
the ideal design. In the few years that elapsed between his disgrace
and death, he came to understand that excellent as absolutism may be in
theory, it has certain disadvantages in fact: and that for one monarch
who is found to satisfy the standard of sovereign virtue, there are
twenty who fall immeasurably beneath it. At the cost of the convictions
of a lifetime he accepted the truth that the only warrant of the people
against anarchy or oppression lay in their own power of self-defence;
and he felt that if strength and virtue were to be restored to the
Government, the people must be placed in a position where they would
at once be able to assist it to do good, and have absolute power to
prevent it doing harm. What the country needed was no longer a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
administrative reform, but nothing less than a national constitution.</p>

<p>That constitution d'Argenson endeavoured to work out; and the fruit
of his reflections was the scheme published in 1784. It cannot be
discussed in the light of experience; for it never was, nor had a
chance of being, submitted to the test of practice. It was not until
twenty-eight years after the author's death that it first saw the
light; and by that time popular demands had become loud and instant,
while a constitutional ideal of a wholly different type had taken
possession of the mind of France. Still there is a certain sense
developed by acquaintance with history and politics which enables us to
estimate with approximate justice the worth of any particular project
in relation to a given set of circumstances; and upon that sense it is
necessary to rely. There is reason to suggest that if examined in the
light of such knowledge as we have of the state of the Government and
of popular feeling about the year 1755, the constitution d'Argenson
conceived at that time is by no means least among the many proofs of
his extraordinary political wisdom.</p>

<p>As few documents of so much importance are so inaccessible or so little
known,<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>
a brief abstract of this remarkable scheme may not be without
use. In presenting it, the form of the original, that of a royal
proclamation, is, so far as possible, preserved; while some striking
passages, which illustrate the prevailing tone and spirit, are given in</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

sans le savoir.</i>"&mdash;"Considérations" (1784).

</blockquote>

<p>d'Argenson's own words. In considering it, it is necessary to remember two
things. In the first place, though popular criticism is irascible
and alert, it has yet made but little way; the people, though
beginning to despise the monarch, are still devoted to the
monarchical tradition. Further it has to be borne in mind that
when the Government did endeavour to act with vigour and to
prosecute measures of constructive reform, it was hampered and
clogged at every turn by the influence of the privileged orders:
while there was no great popular organisation upon which it could
lean for support.</p>

<p>The Constitution is set forth in thirty-four articles, the substance of
which is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Such was the constitution projected by d'Argenson during the few years
before his death. Its real meaning is clear and unmistakable: yet it
has not escaped the evil fortune which has pursued so many of its
author's plans. It is true that to concede to thirty-two provincial
assemblies a virtually absolute power, while providing that the
authority of the Crown shall be in no way diminished, may appear
at first sight as strange an inconsequence as M. de Broglie<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> and
others have found it. Yet a patient reading of d'Argenson's scheme
is sufficient to show that with all its elaborate reservations, it
involved nothing more nor less than the provisional surrender of the
Sovereignty of France into the hands of the French people.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered that in the years which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
succeeded the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, d'Argenson
had been watching with growing alarm the disaffection which was
beginning to ferment:<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> and at the same time his old belief in the
sovereign virtues of absolutism had been profoundly modified by a more
lengthened experience.<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> We have only to bear in mind this change
of opinion in considering his project of reform, to be alive to the
numerous hints which it contains and to detect the real significance of
its provisions. What d'Argenson proposed was virtually this: the whole
administration of the interior was to be ceded to the people of France,
organised in their parishes, districts, and provinces; the royal
bureaucracy, the entire system of intendancies and sub-delegacies was
to be swept away; and the Crown was to be represented in each Province
by four Royal Commissioners, who should open the Estates at the end
of November and explain to the deputies the wishes of the King, while
leaving the execution of them to the Provincial government. These Royal
Commissioners had power to appoint a flying squadron of subordinates,
who were attached to no particular place nor any defined duty, whose
principal business was to report to their superiors, and who were
strictly forbidden to act upon their own authority, or, except in cases
of the last emergency, to employ force against the people. Within
the province not only the whole administration, but the assessment,
collection and payment of the taxes, was entirely in the hands of the
Estates.</p>

<p>"<i>La guerre se faisait alors en nature, et actuellement elle se
fait, pour ainsi dire, en argent.</i>"&mdash;"Considérations" (1784).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We cannot mistake the possible significance of these proposals,
however implicitly it be conveyed. The provision that the King alone
should make laws and impose taxes might be really little more than
a constitutional fiction, which, so long as the laws were prudently
made and the taxes equitably imposed, might pass as undisputed fact.
The proposition that the royal ordinances must always be accepted
might prove to be a fiction of the same kind. Indeed, in certain
eventualities the whole scheme might be one continued fiction in so far
as it relates to the Crown. The Provincial Estates shall not legislate,
but they shall have power to present bills for the royal ratification.
What will happen if their petitions are rejected is a question for time
and circumstance, and not for legislation, to decide. In the same way
the Estates must accept the contribution assessed upon them: but they
may present representations in regard to it. If those representations
are neglected the Estates will proceed as their power and wisdom may
dictate. In a word, the absolute power of the Crown in legislation was
conditioned only by the proper use of it.</p>

<p>D'Argenson had arrived at the conviction that the causes of the evil
from which the country was suffering were the practical nullity of the
Crown and the political nullity of the people; and he felt that the
remedy was to be found in the admission
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
of the people to a share of
power. He knew not less than any of his critics, that where power is
divided differences will arise; but he saw no reason to doubt that if
King and people were guided by a common patriotism and mutual respect,
such differences need never issue in violent collision. At the same
time he knew that when the interests of the King were obstinately
opposed to those of the people, such collisions would occur; they were
calamitous, but they were the lesser of two calamities. He declares
that in the case of "a King who is worthy of the name," such divergence
of interest need never be feared. Should there be a King who was not
worthy of the name, he might be left to the discretion of an indignant
people, and of the most daring and determined man who happened at the
moment to possess their confidence. It was none of d'Argenson's concern.</p>

<p>It is true that we do not find him stating, in this uncompromising way,
the revolutionary aspect of his programme; he would have shrunk from
formulating it clearly even to himself. At the same time we know that
it was by no means distant from his mind. Notwithstanding, he cannot
have regarded it as of any immediate or direct importance; for he could
not but think that only by an access of inconceivable folly on the part
of the people or of inconceivable madness on the part of the Crown,
could such a revolutionary ferment be occasioned.</p>

<p>We cannot better appreciate the spirit and scope of d'Argenson's
proposal than by comparing it with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the universally admired design
broached, about twenty years later, by the great minister Turgot.
The principle of the two policies was practically the same. Turgot
proposed, like d'Argenson, to entrust to the people and popular
organisations the whole administration of the interior, while retaining
the entire legislative authority in the hands of the Crown.<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> The
people, as in d'Argenson's scheme, had merely the power of suggesting
legislation, though the actual law must proceed from the King.
Between the two plans, however, there was one great difference of
detail. D'Argenson had surrounded the authority of the Crown with a
sacred barrier; behind that barrier the people might exercise all the
effective powers of popular control: beyond it they were forbidden to
pass. In the proposal of Turgot that barrier was destroyed. Above the
circle of Provincial Estates he desired to constitute a Municipality
of the Whole Realm; by doing so he would have brought the sphere of
popular action into direct juxtaposition with that of the Crown, and
have surrounded the very palace gates with the acclamations or with the
clamour of the people.</p>

<p>Perhaps both policies, at their several periods, had equally little
prospect of realisation; but if it were necessary to choose between
them with regard to the state of feeling existing and likely to exist
in France, the preference might be given to the earlier plan. For a
time of disturbance and strain, it can claim one signal excellence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
in attempting to provide for the maximum of
exasperation with the minimum of indecency and danger. It is the great
vice of central, but not sovereign assemblies that they can never come
into collision with the Crown without inflicting a grievous blow upon
the prestige and authority of the Crown. The veil which shroud it from
the vulgar gaze, which surrounds it with an air of sacramental mystery,
is torn into a thousand disreputable pieces, and the solemn difference
between King and citizen is seen to fade guiltily away. D'Argenson
feared, and had always feared, that blighting closeness of contact; and
he endeavoured to preserve the influence of the Crown while placing the
people in a position from which, in cases of the last emergency, they
would be able to control the Crown. It is easy to see how the King at
Versailles and a number of Estates in the provincial cities might have
quarrelled to the verge of revolution, and yet how the King, by timely
concession, might have retained his authority unimpaired.</p>

<p>Nor is it hard to answer the question which some have found it
necessary to ask, and to sketch the progress of a revolution proceeding
from the basis of d'Argenson's scheme. Had the Government become
utterly despicable and bad, and had the King shown himself unable or
unwilling to undertake reform, the Provincial Estates might have waited
in patience until popular feeling was at fever height, and then they
might have offered the King his choice between a national insurrection</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Les jalousies réciproques des Princes Chrétiens sont peut-être
aujourd'hui son appui le plus solide.</i>"&mdash;"Considérations" (1784).
[Of the Turkish Empire.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and the acceptance of a certain demand. That demand would have been
that the hundred and twenty-eight deputies who represented the several
Estates at the Court,<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> should be combined in a single assembly in
order to concert measures for the future of the Kingdom. If the King
had yielded, the deputies would have met, and have offered him the
choice between a national insurrection and the acceptance of their
advice. If he chose the latter alternative and endeavoured loyally to
fulfil it, the assembly would disperse, matters would revert to their
normal condition, and a politic effort would be made by all parties
to forget the past. If, on the other hand, he remained contumacious,
the people would resort to that last of political resources employed
by England with such signal success a century and a half before. Such
a state of things was never for a moment likely to arise. In 1755
the tradition of the French Monarchy remained unshaken.<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> A popular
constitution would have been accepted as an act of grace; and the
people would have been engaged too busily in remedying abuses to spend
their strength in factious opposition. Only by suicidal folly on the
part of the Crown could any danger have arisen. A moderate endowment
of public spirit and common sense would have sufficed to protect the
Government;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
and a monarch with one-half of the ability even of
Louis XVI., or one tithe of the devotion maintained for generations
in the House of Hohenzollern, would have been able to maintain his
position with ease.</p>

<p>As a general constitutional proposition d'Argenson's plan is admirable
enough; but when considered in relation to the paramount need of
France at that particular moment it becomes a very master-work of
statesmanship and sagacity. He alone could diagnose the conditions of
the disease and discern the only remedy it was possible to apply. It is
scarcely half the truth to say that the French Revolution was induced
by bad government; there were times when the Government had been
infinitely worse. The cause lay deeper. It lay in a social revolution
which was already complete, and which the Crown refused to recognise.</p>

<p>By the middle of the eighteenth century the institutions of France
had drifted into a condition of which history perhaps can afford no
parallel. The aristocratic corporations of the Church, the law, and
the land, whose influence the Crown for its own purposes had so often
used and abused, were losing every particle of vital force; and the
Monarchy found itself burdened and overborne by the weight of the great
classes upon whom in times past it had leaned for support. The history
of its last forty years is the history of a series of spasmodic efforts
to rise to the grandeur of its great position: and the continual
frustration of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
those efforts through the stolid egotism of the
privileged orders.</p>

<p>Why was it, it may be asked, that what had once been an inexhaustible
source of strength had become a fatal element of weakness? The
cause is to be found in a social revolution which had been silently
proceeding for nearly a century. Ever since the time of Colbert, the
middle classes, the class of tax-farmers, merchants and manufacturers,
had been increasing rapidly in wealth and importance. It was not
the mere growth of a bourgeoisie; it was the rise of a new society,
whose leaders were ready to sow their wealth in the garden of art
and letters. So it was that while lordly ineptitude upon the field
of battle made the French Government a byword in Europe, the name of
France was rendered illustrious by bourgeois triumphs in literature and
the arts.</p>

<p>Coincident with the rise of the middle class was the declining
influence of the Church and the Nobility. For fifty years the Church
had been engaged in one of the most despicable party fights which
history records; its most successful men were witty libertines, who
officiated at the unhallowed sacrament of the "petit souper," and
whose only belief in heaven or earth was in the redeeming virtues of a
cardinal's hat. The nobles were despised by the best among them. They
were hopelessly sunk in debt; and those whose magnificence paid no
interest were subsisting on pensions dispensed by favourites and wrung
from <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
wretches who fed on grass and had no stomach for resistance. The
nobles were outshone by the farmers-general; the Church had ceded her
empire to the "Philosophes"; while financier and "philosophe" were the
social and intellectual leaders of a great society whose growth was
transforming the aspect of France.</p>

<p>Had Fortune dealt as kindly with the Bourbon House as she had lately
done with the failing Hapsburgs: could she have given to France in
Louis XV. the latest and greatest of her kings, the Revolution might
have been undreamed of, and the Bourbons absolute to this day. Such a
man would have discerned the tendency of events: he would have thrown
himself into line with it.<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> He would have sent his nobles beyond the
Rhine, with a mission to die or to justify their existence; he would
have crushed with an iron hand the pretensions of the Church; and
turning Versailles into a national museum, he would have transferred
his Court to the Louvre or the Tuileries, nor would he have allowed it
to be surpassed in brilliance by the salons of the farmers-general.</p>

<p>By putting himself at the head of the new France, he might have
renewed the tradition of the French Monarchy. Such might have been the
work of a great King; but the Great King reviewed his squadrons on
the plain of Potsdam, and devoted to France but a passing jest; and
she was left to the guidance of one of the most pitiable and mean of
men, who could do no more than watch</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

nul n'est facilement esclave dans son pays.</i>"&mdash;"Considérations" (1784).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the clouds and predict the bursting of "Le Déluge."</p>

<p>Effort to avert it there was none. Versailles displayed perhaps as
strange a combination of pomp and vanity as was ever known in the
history of the world. It retained the profusion, without the dignity,
of the Grand Age; and public affairs went as they could while incapable
nobles and dissolute Churchmen exchanged the shuttle of an endless
intrigue. In tradition and spirit it was utterly alien from the new
society. But one representative of the rising classes won her way
into the charmed circle; she entered the Court as Madame d'Etioles;
but before long the wife of the farmer-general was lost in Madame la
Marquise de Pompadour. In public affairs the blindness was equally
insensate. The King consented to trail his ermine in the slush of
ecclesiastical quarrels; and such men as Tencin were the rulers of
France, while Voltaire was reduced to crave the favour of some obscure
lieutenant of police. When at last a man arises who will not take
Madame's gifts, but will consent to copy her music, and who will not
accept a hundred louis for work worth a dozen francs, he is spoken
of as some strange kind of wild animal, "un original d'une nouvelle
espèce," in Madame's own words.<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> And meanwhile the silver-tongued
"bourreau" went on correcting his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
proofs&mdash;of the "Contrat Social"&mdash;and inditing the
charter of those great classes which the French Monarchy continued to
ignore.</p>

<p>No man had cherished more fondly than d'Argenson his hopes of Louis
XV., and none had been more cruelly disappointed. He acknowledged at
last that the Monarchy could not save itself; he would have tried to
save it in spite of itself. His method was the only possible one.
Flinging aside, like a damaged tool, the decrepit organisation of the
privileged orders, he would have called in the assistance of that
great people who held the future in the hollow of their hand. He would
have given them power by their own efforts to redeem the vices of the
Government, and to free that Government from the vesture of privilege
and tradition which clung to it like the shirt of Nessus. For the
two-fold evil from which France was suffering, his scheme provided
a double remedy. The people had no power to demand good government;
the Crown, burdened as it was by the privileged orders, had scarcely
the power to afford it. D'Argenson would have given the people the
necessary power: he would have given the Crown the necessary freedom:
and he would have left it to the patriotism of the nation and the good
sense of the King to restore prosperity to their common country.</p>

<p>D'Argenson's constitution died with him, and he who will may call it a
dream.</p>

<p>It is a pity that such dreams are not more frequent.</p>

<h3>A.<br />
<small>THE FLASSAN MEMOIR.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Memoir (see pp. 116-18 and note 312) is noticed by M. de Broglie,
who rejects it as&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sub1">(i.) Probably unauthentic; as it has not been discovered by him or by
M. Zevort among the ordinary sources; and</span></p>

<p><span class="sub1">(ii.) Certainly unimportant; since it is nowhere referred to, as it
assuredly would have been, in d'Argenson's Memoirs.</span></p>

<p><span class="sub1">Now (i.) unless there existed, not merely this Memoir, but the whole
policy of which it may have been a part, a considerable portion of
the "Mémoires du Ministère" becomes unintelligible. That policy is
constantly referred to throughout Book I., Art. 4 (Rathery, IV. pp.
239-66); and it is mentioned occasionally in the "Mémoires" of 1746,
and in d'Argenson's Journal after he had ceased to be minister. Such a
document, therefore, may naturally exist.</span></p>

<p><span class="sub1">(ii.) This Memoir is given in Flassan, "Histoire de la Diplomatie
Française," V. pp. 242-45 (published [second edition] in 1811).
It deals with facts and not with ideas, and so cannot at once be
recognised as d'Argenson's.</span></p>

<p><span class="sub1">(iii.) On turning to the pages which precede the Memoir, we feel we are
strangely familiar with M. Flassan's text. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
fact is explained by a
comparison with Rathery, Vol. IV. We find, for instance, that Flassan,
V. pp. 236-41, is positively little else than a verbal transcription
from d'Argenson, "Mémoires du Ministère," I. Art. 4 (Rathery, IV. pp.
239-66). It is not a question of the use of an authority, but simply
of the wholesale appropriation of his text. It is generally given in
inverted commas, though the source does not appear to be mentioned;
but in Flassan, V. p. 239, we find a paragraph, beginning "Quoique
véritablement" (Rathery, IV. pp. 256-57), and two entire pages, "La
Savoie," &amp;c., pp. 240-42 (cf. Rathery, IV. pp. 257, 259-60), bodily
transferred without acknowledgment, M. Flassan securing his interest
in the whole by occasionally changing a word or an expression. An
example of the process is a sentence, taken haphazard, on Flassan, V.
p. 240; in four lines of letter-press the only alterations are "dans"
(for d'Argenson's "sur"), and "domaine de l'Autriche" (for d'Argenson's
"domaine autrichienne"; see Rathery, IV. p. 259, line 21). In fact,
the whole account of the early part of d'Argenson's ministry is a
conscientious copy of d'Argenson's text, M. Flassan confining himself
to the transposition, or occasional omission, of paragraphs, and the
changing of unimportant words. The transcription is from the original
manuscripts then in possession of the d'Argenson family, and afterwards
in the Library of the Louvre; and it was executed about fifty years
before the editions either of Jannet or Rathery were issued from the
press.</span></p>

<p><span class="sub1">(iv.) The question suggested by the preceding is, how far is M.
Flassan's account, and therefore presumably the Memoir in question,
derived, borrowed, or taken from the manuscript of d'Argenson's
"Mémoires du Ministère." The answer is that M. Flassan's obligations
are nearly as great throughout the year 1746 as at the close of 1744;
and the only other source of original information a brief examination
has been able to disclose, are the letters and papers of Marshal de
Noailles.</span></p>

<p>The inference is that the memoir ascribed to d'Argenson by a historian
who had ransacked his papers, coinciding with d'Argenson's stated views
(<i>cf.</i> Rathery, IV. p. 257), and found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
among copious extracts from
what Rathery reproduces as d'Argenson's text, is authentic.</p>

<p>There is scarcely need to fall back upon a second line of proof, if
possible even more convincing.</p>

<p><span class="sub1">(v.) In his Introduction to the "Mémoires," M. Rathery states (IV. pp.
127-28) that of the four volumes of Memoirs designed by d'Argenson,
each containing twelve articles, only Arts. I-4 of Vol. I. have been
finally written. Arts. 5-12 of Vol. I. and the whole of Vol. II. were
never edited, but remained in the form of notes and memoranda (IV. p.
125). The whole of Vol. III. exists, but imperfectly; and also Vol.
IV., with the exception of the last few articles. In brief, the memoirs
of the first six weeks of d'Argenson's ministry (Nov. 18-Dec. 31, 1744;
"Mémoires," I. Arts. I-4) are edited completely; <i>those of the year
1745</i> ("Mémoires," I., Arts. 5-12, and II.) <i>are not edited at all</i>,
but were left as notes and memoranda; and those of 1746 are edited, but
imperfectly.</span></p>

<p><span class="sub1">Now (vi.) we find that the second half of Flassan, Vol. V. book 4, is
occupied with a careful and copious account of <i>the first six weeks</i>
of d'Argenson's ministry (mostly in d'Argenson's own words); but no
sooner are those first six weeks over than d'Argenson's manuscript and
Flassan's fulness come to a sudden and simultaneous end; and the events
of the whole year 1745 are disposed of in eight pages, of which the
relations between France and Prussia occupy the four following lines:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"En conséquence de cette communication [Frederick's proposal for peace,
December, 1744, <i>see</i> this essay, p. 103], le roi de Prusse fit, le 25
décembre 1745, sa paix à Dresde, afin de s'assurer la Silésie, qu'il se
fit garantir par l'Angleterre."</p>

<p>In the year 1746 (when the "Mémoires" are edited, but imperfectly)
d'Argenson and M. Flassan are again intimately associated.</p>

<p><span class="sub1">(vii.) The appearance of fulness given to the account of 1745 is
produced by the insertion of three long memoirs: (<i>a</i>) this disputed
memoir to Louis XV.; and (<i>b</i>) a couple more designed by d'Argenson for
the king of Poland. The manner of their appearance is peculiar.</span></p>

<p>On p. 241 (Vol. V.), without any clear connection with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
preceding, M. Flassan writes an original twenty lines of introduction, and
suddenly reproduces the Flassan Memoir (V. pp. 242-45). The Memoir is
followed, not by any consecutive argument, or even by any original
writing, but is simply wedged in its place with a couple of paragraphs
taken word for word from d'Argenson's "Mémoires," I. Art. 4 (one of the
articles perfectly edited, and referring to a period some time before).
Comp. Flassan, V. p. 245, and Rathery, IV. p. 261.</p>

<p>Then follow the eight pages referred to above. They bring Book IV. to a
close.</p>

<p><span class="sub1">(viii.) Book V. opens with three pages of introduction (pp.
257-60),&mdash;certainly borrowed, we believe from d'Argenson's Journal
(which was in manuscript along with the "Mémoires")&mdash;and these are
followed (pp. 260-72) by the two long memoirs for the king of Poland.
Now <i>these memoirs are written by d'Argenson</i>. Unlike the former, they
deal with ideas and not with facts; and we recognise them at once.
This is not a matter of argument; to question any one's opinion upon
such a matter would be simply to impeach his knowledge of the man. The
inference is clear. If these are d'Argenson's, so presumably is the
other.</span></p>

<p>Having dealt with these memoirs, M. Flassan (V. p. 273) proceeds at a
bound to the help given by France to the Chevalier St. George, or, in
other words, to the end of 1745. In 1746 his task is easy.</p>

<p>In brief, we have a copious account of the wholly uneventful first six
weeks; the eventful year 1745 is represented by eight pages of original
writing, and three memoirs attributed to d'Argenson and wedged in their
places with pieces of d'Argenson's text. We submit that the inference
is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>That for his account of the year 1745, and of the last six weeks of
1744, M. Flassan relied entirely upon d'Argenson's manuscript; that
he made copious use of the perfectly edited articles so long as they
held out; and that, finding the year 1745 represented solely by notes
and memoranda, he selected three documents as of peculiar importance,
and one of them the Flassan Memoir. That consequently the Memoir is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
authentic, and was one of the documents designed by d'Argenson as the
basis of the unedited "Mémoires du Ministère," Vol. I. Arts. 5-12, or
Vol. II. It was turned over, but not published, by M. Rathery, who
could not, of course, have realised its critical importance.</p>

<p>The last piece of evidence remains.</p>

<p><span class="sub1">(ix.) This Memoir, with the rest of d'Argenson's manuscripts, perished
in the burning of the Library of the Louvre in 1871. It follows that
neither M. de Broglie (who wrote in 1888 "Marie Thérèse") nor M. Zevort
(in 1879) would have expected to find it if they had known where it
might have been found.</span></p>

<p>M. de Broglie protests that, even if authentic, it is at least
unimportant, as it is not mentioned by d'Argenson in his published
memoirs. To this we reply&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sub2">(i.) That it could not have been, as the memoirs during the period into
which it would have fallen ("au mois de février"&mdash;Flassan) have been
neither edited nor published.</span></p>

<p><span class="sub2">(ii.) That a memoir of an exactly similar character is categorically
mentioned by d'Argenson as having been presented by him to the king a
few weeks before (<i>cf.</i> "Mémoires du Ministère" [Rathery], IV. p. 257,
and this essay, p. 104).</span></p>

<p><span class="sub2">(iii.) That unless the policy set forth in this memoir had a very real
existence, much of the "Mémoires du Ministère," I. Art. 4, and many
scattered references to be found elsewhere, are simply unintelligible.</span></p>

<p>The question is important; for if this memoir is authentic, it follows
that the history of d'Argenson's ministry during the year 1745 has yet
to be written.</p>

<h3>B.<br />
<small>THE TEXTS OF THE "CONSIDÉRATIONS."</small></h3>

<p>Since this essay was written, the two editions of 1764 and 1784 have
been carefully collated, with the object of clearing up the obscurity
which surrounds them. The conclusions are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sub1">A. The text of 1764 was completed some years before d'Argenson's
accession to the ministry, and is based upon a genuine manuscript,
probably as early as those of 1737.</span></p>

<p><span class="sub1">B. The text of 1784, the whole of which is subsequent to his retirement
from the ministry, divides into two parts.</span></p>

<p><span class="sub2">(<i>a</i>) Chapters I.&mdash;VI., and VIII. These chapters represent a part of
the original work as revised and enlarged by the author. The "plan,"
however, which they are designed to elucidate disappears from the
edition, and is replaced (Chapter VII.) by a much vaster project with
which they are not concerned. The date of this revision is probably
about 1750, and it may be placed generally from 1748 to 1752.</span></p>

<p><span class="sub2">(<i>b</i>) Chapters VII., IX., and Conclusion. Chapter VII. contains
the second of d'Argenson's "plans." Chapter IX. and the Conclusion
represent the Chapter VIII., articles 2 and 3, of 1764, re-written with
a view to the second plan. To that "plan" they are pointedly directed,
and they have neither the same date nor the same intention as the
rest of the edition. The date of the second plan and of the second
fragmentary revision is probably about 1755.</span></p>

<p>The evidence for the suggested dates must be succinctly given.</p>

<p>This evidence proves conclusively that a considerable period must have
elapsed between the composition of the texts, a period extending beyond
the close of d'Argenson's ministry. The revised version can scarcely be
earlier than 1748 and scarcely later than 1752. It is separated from
the original by ten to fifteen years.</p>

<p><span class="sub3">(<i>b</i>) Chapters VII., IX., and Conclusion. These chapters are
immeasurably in advance of the rest of the work, and represent a
complete revolution of ideas. We know, on the witness of his invaluable
Journal, that about the year 1753 such a revolution took place in
d'Argenson's mind; and that any time between 1753 and his death in 1757
such ideas were possible and natural to him [see this essay, Chapter
V.]. This portion of the work may be placed approximately about the
year 1755.</span></p>

"Je suis bien ayse de la constance des Catalans.
J'attribue en partie cela à la prudence et à l'adresse avec laquelle
vous les sçavez gouverner" (Letter of July 16, 1643). In another
of September 4th, in the same year, Mazarin speaks to him of "la
reconnaissance que vos services méritent." Mazarin was not the first
great minister whose appreciation d'Argenson won. There exists a letter
of Richelieu, such as is only written to a man upon whose regard
one can lean and upon whose strength one can rely. (Tarascon, July
30, 1632.) (Alfred Barbier, "Notice Biographique sur René de Voyer
d'Argenson." Poitiers, 1885. [Bibliothèque Nationale.])</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_49" id="Footnote_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> It is a little perplexing to find this incident
related under date 1718. It is clear from the tone of the passage
that d'Argenson is little more than a boy, without ordinary official
experience, and by no means a man of twenty four, on the eve of
receiving an Intendancy. Suspicions of the date are confirmed by the
fact that for only twenty-seven days of the year 1718 was his father
Chief of Police at all. The incident probably occurred some time
between 1712, when he appears to have left school, and 1716, when his
public career began. A mistake of the kind might naturally arise, as
the earlier part of the Journal was not written until long after the
events recorded&mdash;probably about 1730.</p></div>

<p>
"Il vient d'y avoir un grand changement entre plusieurs nobles dames
et messieurs, tant de la ville que de la cour.... Madame d'Argenson,
vacante par la mort du chevalier d'Oppède, a choisi pour consolation
le marquis d'Alleurs, jeune homme d'une discrétion au-dessus de son
âge" (December 27, 1717). As we have seen, her husband did not go
comfortless. See p.16.</p></div>

by Barthélemy (II. p. 153): "Un très joli lansquenet, <i>un bon</i> picquet,
quadrille et même brélan." The manuscript has: "Nous avons un très joli
lansquenet, <i>ombre</i>, picquet, <i>cela ne manque en province</i>, quadrille
et memo brélan." It is without stops, but otherwise there is no

succession to Machault in the spring of 1720. In June he was involved
in his father's disgrace: see p. 34. Shortly afterwards he received the
Intendancy of Touraine, and only returned to Paris in the early part
of 1722, when he resumed the direction of the police. In the autumn
of 1723, he became chancellor of the Orléans household, and held that
position at the Regent's death in December. His dismissal from the
police followed a few weeks afterwards: see below (Marais, "Journal,"
III. p. 73). Before the end of January 1724, through the influence of
the young Duke of Orléans, he was provided with a seat at the Council
of State.</p></div>

valuable hints as to the manner in which to pay court to the Cardinal,
and even deigned to instruct him in the etiquette of card-playing,
one of the necessary arts of Court life. "In fact," says d'Argenson
himself, "there is no denying that this first minister neglects no
opportunity of drawing me out and bringing me into prominence; and
that, if I myself were not concerned, I might say that one should think
well of him for helping in this way a zealous and unobtrusive man,
who tries to be of use without knowledge of the brazen art of pushing

ma chère tante, d'inspirer à Madame d'Argenson tous les sentiments
qui vous sont dus. Pardonnez si ce qu'exigent vôtre mérite et vôtre
esprit n'a moins arrêté que les bontés et l'amitié que vous avez pour
moi. J'espère que vous ferez par la suite autant de cas de son amitié
que de son admiration, et je vous assure que je l'élèverai à être
tout ce qu'il y aura de plus respectueux dans vôtre népotisme. Me
voilà-t-il pas bientôt assez à parler en mari fort supérieur d'âge?
Je me trouve respectable par près de dix années de cette supériorité;
je ne m'y serois pas attendu en me mariant aussi jeune." (He was now
twenty-four.) "Je vois l'approbation de tout le monde qui me parle
naturellement sur ce mariage, bien conforme à la vôtre. Je vous assure

there exists a "Counsel's opinion" obtained by Mme. d'Argenson, signed
"De Lambon," and dated September 28, 1756. It throws much light upon
Madame d'Argenson's character, and confirms her husband's estimate of
her. After twenty-two years she had not forgiven; and feeling it an
indignity to be dependent upon her husband for the handsome allowance
he had consented to make her, she proposed to have the separation, both
of person and property, judicially confirmed. Her counsel evidently
thought her claim unwarrantable, and in some of his most moderate words
he says: "But to-day, after more than twenty-two years that they have
lived apart, and after the legal arrangements made by Madame d'Argenson
with her husband in January, 1733, and October, 1747 (le ... ? janvier,
1733, et le ? octobre, 1747), her desire would not be countenanced for
a moment. She would not be permitted to revive the old facts, and to
form a demand for a (judicial) separation, so long as M. d'Argenson
adheres faithfully to that concluded by agreement." The document closes
with the crushing words: "Il vaut mieux se condamner soimême, que de
plaider pour être condamné."</p></div>

"Another idea of mine. We have only had the history of kings, and that
of the nation has not been written. It would seem that for fourteen
hundred years we have had nothing in Gaul but kings, ministers, and
generals; our manners, laws, customs, ideas, are they then nothing?"

speaks of d'Argenson as having been "among
the severest censors of Fleury, whom he reproached bitterly for having
compromised the fair name of France by repudiating his engagements as
to the Austrian succession" ("Marie Thérèse," I. p. 207).
</p>

<p>The passages (Journal, Rathery, III. pp. 296, 299, 328) upon which this
statement is possibly based cannot mean, as the historian would seem to
imply, that d'Argenson was in favour of those engagements and opposed
to their repudiation. He is merely exclaiming against Fleury because,
by his iniquitous acceptance of those engagements, he had been driven
to the further iniquity of violating them. D'Argenson, like everybody
else, had thought the Pragmatic Sanction preposterous, and no one was
more astounded than he at the calm which followed the death of Charles
VI. Here is one passage which is chosen from a score:
</p>

<p>"Quelle conduite! Tout ne demanderait qu'à aller, animer et fortifier
le plus faible, rompre la glace, diviser le grand morceau des États
Autrichiens; voilà à quoi nous n'arriverons point, et quelle occasion
perdue!" (Journal, Rathery, III. p. 230).
</p>

<p>When at last the ice was broken by Frederick, and there is talk of
an offensive alliance between France and Prussia, it is true that
d'Argenson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
recoils; but he is careful to make the reason clear: for he
dreads the effect of a war of ambition on the prosperity of the French
provinces (Ibid., III. pp. 305, 310). Yet no sooner does the war resume
the aspect of a triumphal march than all his old enthusiasm for the
dismemberment of the Hapsburg dominion revives (Ibid., III. pp. 342,
344, 409, &amp;c.).
</p>

<p>For the whole episode see passages indicated in Appendix C.
</p>

<p>D'Argenson's real quarrel with Fleury was (1) that he had subscribed to
the Pragmatic Sanction at all; (2) not that he had repudiated it, but
that he had neglected to provide himself with a decent excuse for doing
so (Ibid., III. pp. 296, 328, &amp;c.).</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_281" id="Footnote_281"></a><a href="#FNanchor_281"><span class="label">[281]</span></a> M. de Broglie represents ("Marie Thérèse," I. pp. 202-4)
that d'Argenson's policy involved the abandonment of the allies of
France. The grounds for the contention are not quite clear. It would
be equally true of Frederick's own recent proposal for an immediate
peace (Zevort, p. 131). France at this time actually held sufficient
territory to satisfy her allies upon the terms proposed by Frederick
("Mémoires du Ministère," Rathery, IV. p. 258); and she had only to
defend it, as d'Argenson said, with foresight and success, to weary her
enemies and force upon Maria Theresa conditions of peace which would be
acceptable to her allies as well as to herself.
</p>
<p>
The occurrence of such suggestions is easily explained. M. de Broglie
makes no secret of his strong approval of the campaign in Flanders, and
of his strong antipathy to Frederick II. In both respects, though in
the case of the Flemish campaign he would appear to have no suspicion
of it, he is at absolute variance with the French Foreign Minister; and
he is consequently constrained to regard him in a spirit which does
not conduce to critical appreciation. In the view of the writer, his
account of d'Argenson's share in the events of 1745 cannot be taken as
even approximately just.
</p>
<p>
Upon the merits of the rival policies it is not our business to
decide. It is sufficient to show that d'Argenson's plans were sound
and statesmanlike, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
that successive disasters were entailed by the
failure of the Government to support him.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_294" id="Footnote_294"></a><a href="#FNanchor_294"><span class="label">[294]</span></a> But three lines appearing in a despatch drafted by him
(January 31, 1745. Zevort, Appendix, p. 352) are sufficient to prove
what might have been suspected:
</p>
<p>
"En effet n'en aurions-nous tant fait en faveur de la liberté
germanique que pour la revoir tombée dans son ancien esclavage."
</p>
<p>
Only one hand could have written the word "esclavage."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_295" id="Footnote_295"></a><a href="#FNanchor_295"><span class="label">[295]</span></a> "Where we should look for the breadth of view and the
decision of the statesman, we find but the emotion of a doctrinaire
who has attained to office full of confidence in his theories, and
who finds himself suddenly thrown into a confused medley of practical
complications which he had not even suspected; it is the bewilderment
of a solitary who issues from obscurity and is blinded by the
unexpected play of light" (De Broglie, "Marie Thérèse," I. p. 208).
</p>
<p>
Upon this we remark that the above is based upon "the first
instructions which he sends after the unforeseen event of Munich;"
that that event destroyed a great system, and created what Frederick
described as "a terrible crisis"; and that it was just because
d'Argenson realised, with a statesman's breadth of view, the appalling
consequences either at home or abroad, that he hesitated to take
his choice of disasters. When grave issues are so nicely balanced,
precipitation is a sign, not of strength, but of weakness.
</p>
<p>
Frederick, it is true, did not hesitate; and M. de Broglie aptly
supplies the reason. A man does not hesitate about the next move when
he has no alternative but to throw up the game (De Broglie, "Marie
Thérèse," I. p. 219, &amp;c., <i>cf.</i> Zevort, pp. 137, 138).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_296" id="Footnote_296"></a><a href="#FNanchor_296"><span class="label">[296]</span></a> On the evidence of a certain note, M. de Broglie
suggests ("Marie Thérèse," I. p. 213) that d'Argenson was by no means
at one with the Council, and that he accepted with reluctance a policy
which was forced upon him.
</p>
<p>
The note may be read with equanimity, for it only marks the
reappearance of an ideal regret, to be met with occasionally in
d'Argenson's Journal&mdash;a regret for the policy of merely indirect
interference which he sometimes mentions in connection with "un habile
homme tel que M. Chauvelin." His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
true feeling with regard to the
crisis is conveyed by some important words in the note immediately
preceding:
</p>

<p>
"Il en arrivera ce qui pourra, bien, j'espère; <i>mais pour la paix et
un armistice dans le statu quo, il n'y faut plus penser</i>" (De Broglie,
"Marie Thérèse." I. p. 211).
</p>

<p>
It is admitted that d'Argenson was not the prime mover in the policy of
the Council; he looked upon that policy as little short of desperate;
but he accepted it as a choice between two evil alternatives; and,
as we shall find, he did everything mortal man could do to make it a
success.</p></div>

describing this as "the beginning of the old game" ("Marie Thérèse,"
I. pp. 219, 220). Frederick, with the knowledge and concurrence of the
French Government (Zevort, p. 142), was already in communication with
England; he had not yet heard the intentions of France; he could have
no assurance that she meant to prosecute the war; and thinking his
position perilous, he took immediate steps to extricate himself with as
little loss as possible. Allowing time for the courier to travel from
Munich to Berlin, it is clear that these instructions were despatched
within a couple of days after the news of the Emperor's death first
reached him. Certainly it was a scuttling policy; and there is no
reason to suppose it would have been pursued had the war policy of
France been loyally supported.</p></div>

The writer believes that there is ample evidence to show where it might

should be one of the most important records of the time. The evidence
is such as the historian, upon his own admission, would probably accept

note of time given by Flassan is "au mois de février" (1745). From the

<p><a name="Footnote_347" id="Footnote_347"></a><a href="#FNanchor_347"><span class="label">[347]</span></a> As an example of the straits to which d'Argenson was
reduced through the failure of the French Government to support his
policy, we may cite some remarks of his to the French representative at
Frankfort in reference to the retreat of Conti.
</p>
<p>
"It appears that the King of Poland, having always regarded the
continuance of the French army in the neighbourhood of Frankfort as
an obstacle to the success of the views which he has formed from the
beginning in regard to the imperial crown, is on the point of declaring
himself a candidate."
</p>
<p>
It is absurd to suppose that d'Argenson really meant this, or looked
upon the retreat as a subject of congratulation. It was simply one of
the kaleidoscopic movements by which events, affected as they were by
successive disasters, might still be made to look beautiful.
</p>
<p>
The resource, perhaps, was a little ridiculous; but it is hard to see
what he would have done without it.</p></div>

(p. 101). He tells Brühl that d'Argenson is "so 'bête' that the King

Noailles was the lady to whom d'Argenson had been attached for sixteen
years. He has left a rather striking description of her (see Journal,
under date 1728). They occupied adjoining houses in the Rue de Gros
Chenet, some drawings of which are to be found among d'Argenson's

</p>
<p>
"It was not for general incapacity that the Marquis d'Argenson was
dismissed, nor for having forgotten one day to open the despatches from
Genoa. It was because he was obstinately attached to a false policy,
to a policy disapproved by Maurice de Saxe, who at this moment was
governing France" (p. 152).</p></div>

reservé avec eux. Ces messieurs, pour le distinguer de son frère,
l'appellent 'd'Argenson le Bête.' Les gens honnêtes ont nommé le
ministre de la guerre 'd'Argenson l'intrigant'" ("Correspondance,"
Gaçon-Dufour, p. 90).
</p>
<p>
These letters are far from reflecting the very poor opinion of
d'Argenson which is said to have been prevalent at Court. Such may
have been the opinion of his political rivals and of the circle of
Madame de Pompadour, to which d'Argenson, in person and principle, was
consistently opposed. It might well have acquired the substance of a
tradition, and have affected later criticism unduly.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_375" id="Footnote_375"></a><a href="#FNanchor_375"><span class="label">[375]</span></a>
It is necessary to grasp this point if we are to avoid
a frequent prejudice against d'Argenson, a prejudice which arises from
regarding him as a man of very large pretensions and of very inadequate
performance. There is no good ground for believing in his utter
failure, or consequently in the hollowness of his pretensions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_376" id="Footnote_376"></a><a href="#FNanchor_376"><span class="label">[376]</span></a> Perhaps it is necessary to reinforce this point. It
is to be remembered that in any acutely critical period, wisdom is a
matter of months or weeks. Never even for seven days can opinion safely
be divorced from circumstance. It is quite true that a general view of
the relations of France with the German powers during the last century
and a half suggests that at the time with which we are concerned her
traditional anti-Austrian policy was tending to become an anachronism;
but we must be careful about making that general view the basis of
particular conclusions. The available documents prove conclusively that
whenever that tendency began to approach perceptibility and power, it
was never in the course of d'Argenson's ministry, still less during the
critical year 1745.
</p>
<p>
In and throughout that year France had but one competitor on the
continent&mdash;Austria. The position of Prussia&mdash;if in connection with
France and Austria we may assign her the dignity of a position&mdash;was in
the highest degree precarious. No one knew it better than the Prussian
king himself. There was probably not a moment in the course of the
year when he did not feel himself to be within an ace of destruction;
not an episode but betrays his anxiety for escape with honour. His
efforts for peace in January; his desperate overtures at London after
the death of the Emperor; his earnest, eloquent entreaties to maintain
the Elector of Bavaria and the Prince of Conti; his dull bitterness
and despair at the Convention of Augsburg and the withdrawal of the
French from Germany; his continued pressure upon England, ending in the
Treaty of Hanover; finally, his studious moderation when he appeared as
a conqueror in Dresden; all point to but one conclusion. His position
was, and he knew it be, desperate; and it was only the headlong courage
of desperation that enabled him to see the year out safely.
</p>
<p>
The definitive rise of Prussia is probably to be dated from the Peace
of Dresden, and not one moment before. Moreover it cannot have been
immediately apparent. One year after the treaty of peace d'Argenson
fell; and during that year Prussia was recovering from the effects of
the war, and her ambitions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
and prospective power can have been present
to the mind of Frederick alone. At what particular period her advance
must have become sufficiently evident to affect the views of statesmen,
only a profound study of that single question can disclose. Certain it
is that it cannot have been at any period during d'Argenson's ministry,
or more especially during the year 1745.
</p>
<p>
The truth of the matter appears to be this. Events were rapidly
tending towards, though they had not yet reached, a condition of which
d'Argenson had often dreamed. Prussia, if her power developed, might
one day be strong enough to stand alone against the Austrian House; and
France would be free to watch the contest, and might leave the rivals
to ruin each other. But this was still in the future; and the time
was yet apparently distant when a responsible French minister could
entertain the idea of an Austrian alliance.
</p>

<p>
It is true that there was already an Austrian party in the Council;
there is always such a party in any council. There are men who cannot
resist the fascination of cheap success, who are devoted to a policy of
ease with honour. They are not prominent in the ranks of statesmen.</p></div>

character to which Count d'Argenson could lay no claim.</p></div>

and afterwards given as an act of charity to la Motte, who was one of
d'Argenson's old masters at the Collège Louis-le-Grand. The book was
published without d'Argenson's sanction, but his share in the work was

de l'Angleterre, sont des précautions que le maître prend contre
le maître; emprunteur, il fait impôt, et destine tous les ans une
partie de cet impôt pour rembourser; par là il charge davantage ses

D'Argenson's ideas on economics are marked by his usual acuteness
and independence. He was not a member of the physiocratic school;
and though he joined the Economists in deploring the sacrifice of
agriculture to manufacturing industry, he did not share their peculiar
views as to the exclusive value of land. He was one of the earliest
and soundest of Free Traders, maintaining that commerce should not be
interfered with except for purely fiscal purposes.</p></div>

In January, 1747, d'Argenson was nominated by the King
President of the "Académie des Inscriptions et des Belles-Lettres"
(Journal, Rathery, V. p. 349). He gives an amusing account of his
original election (Journal, Rathery, I. pp. 165-75). The only
contribution of his we have been able to discover in the Journals of
the Academy is a paper on French historians and the writing of history
(XXVIII. pp. 626-46).</p></div>

little to say that it is by far the ablest criticism of d'Argenson at
present existing. It is presumption even to praise a work so admirably
performed. It presents one or two features which one may do oneself the
honour to note.
<br />
<span class="sub2-5">(<i>a</i>) M. Aubertin seems to accept a little too readily the idea of</span><br />
<span class="sub1">d'Argenson's practical incapacity. He has not of course examined</span><br />
<span class="sub1">the events of his ministry.</span><br />
<span class="sub1">(<i>b</i>) He regrets that d'Argenson should have occupied himself</span><br />
<span class="sub1">with his practical ambitions, instead of confining himself to</span><br />
<span class="sub1">the region of Speculation. It seems clear that to a man of</span><br />
<span class="sub1">d'Argenson's temperament, speculative was dependent on practical</span><br />
<span class="sub1">activity; and that had he resigned himself to be a mere thinker,</span><br />
<span class="sub1">his power as a thinker would have been destroyed completely.</span><br />
<span class="sub1">We have to accept d'Argenson upon his own terms as a practical</span><br />
<span class="sub1">reformer before we can hope to do him justice.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_417" id="Footnote_417"></a><a href="#FNanchor_417"><span class="label">[417]</span></a> Other notable features of the scheme are:&mdash;
<br />
<span class="sub2-5">(<i>a</i>) Principles of taxation. Total exemption for raw materials;</span><br />
<span class="sub1">light taxes upon permanent stock and plant; the burden of taxation</span><br />
<span class="sub1">to fall upon articles of consumption (Article XV.).</span><br />

<span class="sub1">to the Government, one-fourth to be retained for local purposes</span><br />
<span class="sub1">(Article XV.).</span><br />
<span class="sub2-5">(<i>c</i>) The reduction of the Intendancies, to an extent "smaller</span><br />
<span class="sub1">than the present 'Généralités'"; if the present reduction</span><br />
<span class="sub1">succeeds, it may proceed further, until the Intendancy shall</span><br />
<span class="sub1">comprise no more than two hundred parishes, and the Sub-delegacy</span><br />
<span class="sub1">no more than twenty.</span><br />
<span class="sub2-5">(<i>d</i>) The Intendant shall retain a single post no longer than</span><br />
<span class="sub1">three years; by this means he will be prevented from establishing</span><br />
<span class="sub1">local connections to the prejudice of the public service, and</span><br />
<span class="sub1">be inspired to exert what ability he possesses by the hope of</span><br />
<span class="sub1">obtaining a more lucrative place. #/ </span></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_418" id="Footnote_418"></a><a href="#FNanchor_418"><span class="label">[418]</span></a> We have to guard against confounding d'Argenson's
philosophical disquisitions with his definite project of reform. He
held himself bound to establish principles as well as to formulate
proposals, and he expressly declares that the writer of such a work
as his must seek the counsels of perfection, however distant they may
seem at the moment from the realm of practical politics. And herein is
d'Argenson's greatness as a political
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
thinker, that he never fails to
see, or to see the distinction between, what is best in principle and
what is possible in practice.
</p>
<p>
Thus, he denounces the "pernicious system" of the traffic in judicial
positions; but in his definite Plan of 1764 (1737) he says not a
word of it, owing to the practical difficulty of reimbursing those
whose interests would be sacrificed to the reform. He goes no further
than to provide, in Article 51, against the growth of the abuse
in connection with the new municipal offices which he proposes to
create. In course of time however he became convinced that the nation
would be benefitted, and that funds might be raised for compensating
office-holders, by the sale of the Crown lands; and accordingly in
the Plan of 1784 (1755), the practical difficulty being overcome, the
"pernicious system," untouched by the project of 1764 (1737), is swept
away at a stroke.
</p>
<p>
Again, as to the nobility. It is true that in Chapter VIII. Article 2,
pp. 305-8 [1764 (1737)], d'Argenson formulates certain objections to
the principle of a hereditary noble class; and further, that he dilates
elsewhere upon the harm done by the survival of the vexatious feudal
privileges exacted by the noblesse. Yet in his definite Plan he neither
touches the nobility as a class, nor does he lay a finger upon any of
the privileges pertaining to it. On the contrary, the continuance of
the seigneurial jurisdictions, which are deliberately abolished in the
later scheme of 1784 (1755), is incidentally recognised, p. 221 (1764).
</p>
<p>
The facts with regard to the three classes mentioned by M. Martin may
be stated as follows:&mdash;
<br />
<span class="sub2-5">(<i>a</i>) The bureaucracy.</span><br />
<span class="sub1">By the Plan of 1764 (1737) the ministry, the administrative councils,</span><br />
<span class="sub1">the Intendants, the Sub-delegates, in a word, the great standing</span><br />
<span class="sub1">bureaucratic organisation, was to continue intact. It was even</span><br />
<span class="sub1">strengthened. It is true that in the scheme of 1784 (1755) its lower</span><br />
<span class="sub1">ranks were relaxed; but with that scheme we are not concerned, as it is</span><br />
<span class="sub1">not noticed by M. Martin.</span><br />
<span class="sub2-5">(<i>b</i>) The judicial aristocracy.</span><br />
<span class="sub1">By neither of d'Argenson's Plans was the existence of the judicial</span><br />
<span class="sub1">aristocracies affected in the least. In that of 1764 (1737) the</span><br />
<span class="sub1">functions of the Parlements are even extended (Article 42). It is true</span><br />
<span class="sub1">that he attacks the system of purchase upon which the Companies were</span><br />
<span class="sub1">organised; but that system is untouched by the earlier Plan, and is</span><br />
<span class="sub1">only abolished [in 1784 (1755)] when means have been found of replacing</span><br />
<span class="sub1">it, and of compensating those who were subjected to forfeiture.</span><br />
<span class="sub2-5">(<i>c</i>) The noblesse.</span><br />
<span class="sub1">Under the scheme of 1764 (1737) the nobility had nothing to fear. Their</span><br />
<span class="sub1">privileges, even those which d'Argenson disliked most strongly, are</span><br />
<span class="sub1">maintained intact. It is only in the Plan of 1784 (1755) that the high</span><br />
<span class="sub1">seigneurial jurisdictions are suppressed, and that the nobles are made</span><br />
<span class="sub1">to share with the roturiers in the ordinary burdens of the state. Even</span><br />
<span class="sub1">then their honorary distinctions are scrupulously conserved; the more</span><br />
<span class="sub1">powerful of them are created Peers of their several Provinces; and</span><br />
<span class="sub1">express provision is made for the continued magnificence of the Royal</span><br />
<span class="sub1">Household.</span><br /></p>

<p>
As to the destruction of the nobility, nothing could have been further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
from d'Argenson's mind. He was himself a nobleman; and, if he had
none of the prejudice, he had all the pride of his class. He advocates
the suppression of old feudal privileges in the belief that they can
be regretted by none but those whose devotion to the dignity of their
order amounts to madness, "jusqu'à la folie" [p. 126 (1784)]. He
repudiates the intention of debasing an aristocracy; in his own words,
"il n'est question que d'extirper une satrapie roturière et odieuse"
[p. 312 (1764)]. His only quarrel is with the nobleman's claims to "le
droit de chasse sur ses voisins, source de querelles et d'insultes;
les droits considérables de mutation et de reliefs en cas de vente et
même de succession collatérale, par où les terres mal administrées
passent plus difficilement dans des mains qui les cultiveroient mieux;
l'exercice de la justice seigneuriale négligé partout et pratiqué par
une race de gens avides, toujours occupés à exciter l'habitant simple
à plaider; enfin tous ces différens droits, procés, chicanes, vieilles
recherches, empèchement à la bonne culture des terres, rétrécissement
de l'abondance, obstacle au bonheur de la campagne" [pp. 120-21 (1784),
<i>cf.</i> pp. 119-20 (1764)]. These d'Argenson would have swept away; and
in doing so he would have reduced the French nobility, or rather he
would have raised it, to the position actually occupied by one of the
most powerful aristocracies in the world, the nobility of England.
</p>
<p>
No more cruelly keen-sighted man than d'Argenson ever lived. He only
differs from most men of equal vision in that his clear perception of
life as it was did not breed in him disgust and cynical acceptance.
His mind could command two worlds, the real and the ideal; but only
intimate knowledge can follow him at will into either, or avoid the
critical gaucherie of mistaking aspiration for illusion.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_419" id="Footnote_419"></a><a href="#FNanchor_419"><span class="label">[419]</span></a> Perhaps one source of obscurity is d'Argenson's
unhappy title. By "la démocratie" he means, not "democracy," but "the
democratic element." He was early taken to task for this ambiguity
of phrase. Bound up with one of the manuscripts in the Arsenal are
half-a-dozen sheets of criticism returned to d'Argenson by St. Pierre
in the spring of 1738. St. Pierre begins by saying that democracy is a
form of government in which the final voice on public questions rests
with the majority of the people, and that the author has really no
right to speak of "democracy" in connection with his scheme. Attached
to these sheets is a pretty little letter, which is interesting enough
to reproduce.

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_420" id="Footnote_420"></a><a href="#FNanchor_420"><span class="label">[420]</span></a> Voltaire to d'Argenson, June 21, 1739 (Garnier). In
speaking of this letter, M. de Broglie represents that Voltaire
regarded d'Argenson's book merely as the lucubration of an influential
fool, and that his congratulations and criticism were utterly insincere
("Marie Thérèse," I. pp. 187-90).
</p>
<p>
The origin of this, at first sight, astonishing suggestion is not
very hard to discover. The historian happened to have read the
"Considérations" in the edition of 1784. Unaware of the divergencies
between the two editions, he of course assumed that it was the Plan
published in 1784 in reference to which Voltaire was writing; and
failing very naturally to understand how, in regard to it, Voltaire
could have meant what he said, was driven to suggest that he said what
he did not mean; that, in short, Voltaire thought d'Argenson a fool,
and chose to flatter him for his own purposes.
</p>
<p>
This is a grave imputation upon both men; and the grounds for it
disappear entirely when Voltaire's letters are read in connection with
the Plan of 1764 (1737), of which he was actually writing. His meaning
at once becomes natural and clear. D'Argenson had been arguing against
over-centralisation, and had advocated the introduction of local
government upon a very modest scale. Voltaire replies that a system not
dissimilar in effect, was already at work in England; that there local
affairs proceeded without the intervention of a Council of State; and
that the law-abiding character of the English people was largely due to
their habit of local self-government. The argument is quite clear, and
is simply destroyed by equivocal interpretation.
</p>
<p>
Voltaire's feeling on receiving the book was one of keen surprise and
warm admiration. For months afterwards his letters are witness to the
impression it produced upon him. So cordial and frank are they that
it was at first difficult to conceive by what process the idea of
insincerity could have been fathered upon them.
</p>
<p>
Had Voltaire really written in such a spirit, not only his reputation
as a critic but his honour as a man would have suffered very gravely.
For months past d'Argenson had been straining every nerve to defend him
from "the literary police;" and to have written to his protector as the
historian suggests, would have been an act of black dishonour. It is
true that there were men before whom Voltaire could abase and debase
himself; but d'Argenson the philosophe, his old school friend, was not
one of them. With the exception of Count d'Argental, there is not one
of his correspondents to whom Voltaire writes with such openness and
freedom.</p></div>
